A very welcome return to form for a distillery with enormous potential.","10841":"44 years of quiet maturation in the famous number one vaults, has allowed an exceptional and rare example of Bowmore single malt to develop \u2013 the oldest one ever to be released from the distillery.","10894":"A smart packaging job for this distillery-bottled expression of Benromach 10yo, which has been a big hit since its introduction in late 2009. Well done to G&M; for making the standard release strength 43%.","109":"At 25 years old this whisky embodies the richness, depth and sweetness of all Ardbegs. Light gold in colour and powerful in character. A phenomenal, much-sought-after bottling of a really outstanding malt.","10994":"A no-age-statement expression from Speyburn. Bradan Orach means Golden Salmon, according to our exhaustive research.","10997":"Dalmore\u2019s trademark style is luscious notes of orange, chocolate and spices, and the 18 Year Old bottling is a terrific example.

A big thumbs-up.","11252":"A quarter bottle of the hugely popular Edradour 10yo single Highland malt.","114":"A fine drop of Ardbeg bottled at cask strength. A marriage of Ardbeg from bourbon barrels and sherry butts which gives a sweet and smoky finish to this malt. Uigeadail is the loch from which all Ardbeg water flows. An absolutely stunning whisky, and following the demise of Airigh nam Beist, this probably represents the best value in the core range.","11482":"Benriach 16yo is a terrific malt from a distillery that has really shot up after years of Seagram neglect. A delicious, complex all-rounder.","11506":"A hard to find bottling of Laphroaig 15 year old which we estimate was bottled during the 1990s.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","117":"A very special bottle of 1967 vintage whisky from Ardbeg distillery. This whisky has been matured for 30 years in an Oloroso sherry cask, giving it a beautifully dark colour.","11793":"A 12yo Highlander from Glengoyne, famed for their unpeated single malt.

A 40yo sherried Speyside designed for drinking rather than sitting on a mantlepiece or in a display cabinet - bravo. Awarded a very well-merited Gold Medal at the Malt Maniacs Awards 2010.","11919":"A single cask of Inchgower 1993, bottled in 2009 from European Sherry Oak by owners Diageo for the Managers' Choice series. Amazing colour on this.","11920":"A single sherry cask of the little-seen Mannochmore, this is from the 1998 vintage and was bottled in 2009 for the Managers' Choice range.","12052":"A 15 year-old expression of Singleton of Dufftown, Diageo's easy-drinking Speysider. This is a mix of European and American oak casks, producing a smooth, sweet, approachable style and a spicy, drying finish.","12069":"A cask-strength 21yo from Tomatin, a distillery which has really benefited from a bit of brand investment recently, with a packaging facelift and a flurry of highly-regarded new releases. Expect smooth, spicy wood influence and more than a hint of sherry in the mix.","12084":"Long known as 'the gentle dram' Tomintoul 16yo is soft and nutty, with a pleasant richness. A Gold Medal winner at the International Wine & Spirits Competition (IWSC), this is a cracking dram for the money.","12105":"Introduced in 2010, after cask strength versions in 2004 and 2005, this is the first officially-bottled Caol Ila 25yo to be bottled at 43%. It's nice to see growing recognition for this excellent distillery, and this is a very welcome addition to the official range, with a rich, gentle mouthfeel and restrained, coal-esque phenols.","12183":"Distilled in 1971 and matured in a small batch of exquisite Oloroso sherry casks, this 33 year-old dram appeared in 2004 and at the time was the oldest and quite possibly the best Glendronach ever released. Boasting 95\/100 from Jim Murray's Whisky Bible and a Gold Medal at the San Francisco Spirits Competition, this is not a dram to miss.","12213":"An official bottling of 12 year old Highland Park in the distillery's dumpy bottle. In 1979, the owners invested in marketing the single malt, which led to a massive increase in sales at the time this bottle would have been released.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","12253":"An exuberantly spicy malt, with plenty of sherry influence, Glen Ord is a fine example of the Highland style and very good value for money. This bottling is now discontinued, to be replaced by Singleton of Glen Ord, so grab one while you can.","12603":"Glenmorangie Lasanta now boasts an age statement of 12 years old.

This museum-worthy round bottle (Glenfiddich did not appear in its now-iconic triangular bottle until 1963) is one of the earliest Glenfiddichs we've found, and represents a significant piece of whisky history.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","1274":"A very interesting dram, the only Speysider to be triple-distilled like a Lowland malt or Irish whiskey, but with a lot more body and character than either of those styles. Impressive stuff.","12802":"A 21yo has been added to Glencadam's rapidly-growing range. Attractively packaged and bottled at a good drinking strength of 46%, this is a distillery of great potential and definitely one to watch.","12827":"A giant leap forward for Bunnahabhain 12yo, this edition was launched in summer 2010 with a jump in strength to 46.3% and a declaration of no chill-filtration and no added colouring. The producers deserve enormous credit for giving punters what they want without jacking up the price too much and we earnestly hope that this will be a massive success. Bravo!","12906":"Released in late 2010, this Arran 14yo is intended to be the standard issue bottling, taking over from the 12yo that appeared in late 2008. As has always been the case with Arran's malt, this has been neither coloured nor chill-filtered and has been bottled at a sensible drinking strength of 46%, for which the management deserve maximum kudos.","12907":"After a remarkable (if understandable) proliferation of single cask bottlings with experimental and occasionally unfortunate wine finishes, Arran have plumped for a core range of just three finished malts, of which this Amarone red wine finish is the driest. Earthy and complex.","12908":"A bold, sweet Port finish from Arran, released in late 2010 as part of the downsized standard offering from the distillery now that their malt is fully mature. Bottled at 50%, so some water may be preferred.","12971":"A no-age-statement entry-level Glen Grant, focusing on their mission to make light and easy-drinking whisky. This is a very accessible, approachable malt ideal for beginners or as an aperitif.","12983":"Peaty whisky from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, named after a previous incarnation of the distillery. Maritime and smoky, this rivals some of the Islay drams for power, and the 10 year old balances the intensity of youth with rounded, well-aged spirit.","12984":"A sophisticated single malt from the Tobermory distillery, which is based on the Isle of Mull. Aged for 10 years in ex-bourbon casks, this unpeated whisky abounds with notes of gingerbread, honey, aniseed and rich fruit.","13015":"An exciting release for Diageo's 2010 Super Premium releases - this is the first mainstream officially bottled Auchroisk since the demise of the original Singleton range at the turn of the century.","1304":"The first entry in Diageo's Special Releases series for Brora, a mainstay since 2002. This set the high standard that the releases are now known for and is almost unanimously rated at over 90 points by the Malt Maniacs.","1305":"'Rich and complex, this unfolds slowly and has richness, balance, texture, sweet waxy fruits and a lift of smoke. Some package. 9\/10' Dave Broom, Whisky Magazine April 2004","1306":"Diageo's third release of 30 year old whisky from Brora, Bottled in 2004 at a cask strength of 56.6%. These 30 year olds are all fantastic and this is one of the best of the bunch.","1307":"One of only ten Gold Medal-winners at the Malt Maniacs Awards 2007, this is an absolute belter.","13195":"Glenmorangie's Quinta Ruban was upgraded in late 2010, and is now sporting a 12yo age statement where previously there was none.","13318":"A 20cl quarter bottle of the lipsmacking Benromach 10yo, which has been a revelation since its introduction by owners Gordon & Macphail in late 2009, and is really putting this great distillery back on the map.","13402":"A very stylish gift pack containing a bottle of the splendid Edradour 10yo from Scotland's smallest distillery, along with two branded Glencairn glasses from which to enjoy it.","1354":"A 2002 distillery bottling of 1970 Bruichladdich matured for about 32 years. This has gone down as one of the best Bruichladdichs in modern memory - a 95 from Whisky Fun's Serge Valentin (and listed as his favourite expression from the distillery), a pile of superlatives in posts across the internet and a quick 'Amazing!!' when we just mentioned it on Twitter.","13572":"The second of Macallan's Masters of Photography series sensibly avoids the controversies of the first, with a special 20yo sherried whisky and a book of photos by Albert Watson on the journey of the sherry cask. The presentation box contains ten of these photos reproduced as special prints.","13587":"The second in Glenmorangie's series of Private Editions (the first being the hugely popular Sonnalta), Finealta has sparked interest in that some lightly peated barley has been used in its creation - supposedly inspired by an (ahem) recently-discovered 1903 order for Glenmorangie from the Savoy hotel. The name is Gaelic for 'Elegance', it says here, and Finealta has been matured in ex-sherry and plain new American oak casks.","13626":"This is the relaunched version of Bunnahabhain 18yo, having ditched the caramel colouring and chill-filtration and upped the strength to 46.3%. A triumph for 'naturalist' whisky drinkers.","137":" A 1970s square bottle of 8 year old Aberlour, bottled at 50% for the Italian market. These high strength old Aberlours enjoy a particularly lofty reputation. This bottle was produced for the Italian market.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","1374":"From the oldest vintage in the Bruichladdich cellars, this is the oldest ever bottling by the distillers. The whisky was distilled in October 1964 and filled into fresh bourbon casks before four decades of slow ageing on the Islay coast. The result is probably the most complex Bruichladdich ever produced. A triumph from a great distillery.","13992":"Glenmorangie's Nectar d'Or is a 12 Year Old whisky finished in Sauternes casks. This is sweet and spicy with notes of ginger, nutmeg lemon meringue and honeycomb.","140":"Aberlour 10yo is a great entry-level malt, ideal for beginners, with a fine sherried spiciness. Pound for pound, this is one of the best that Speyside has to offer.","1401":"This was Bunnabahhain's 2003 Feis Isle bottling. A vatting of the last seven hogsheads of 1963 Bunnahabhain that were in existence, which yielded 743 bottles at a cask strength of 42.9%.","1405":"A legendary 1968 bottling of Bunnahabhain. Aged in sherry casks for around 34 years before release in 2002, this scored a huge 93 points from malt maniac Serge Valentin and scores over 90 points from 12 of the others.","143":"Aberlour is always a good choice - one of the best value Speyside malts around. This double matured version is a mix of traditional oak and sherry casks and is rich and fruity with delicious Christmas cake notes.","14444":"The 3rd batch of Laphroaig's riotously popular small batch editions of their famed 10yo cask strength Islay single malt. No doubt this will be as big a hit as the previous editions - this is an expression that never disappoints.","14469":"A no-age-statement whisky from Deanston bottled at 46.3%. This one is made up of young whisky which is decanted into new American oak casks for its final stages of maturation.","1461":"A much-loved single malt, Cardhu is an easy-going, charming Speysider. With clean, crisp oak and sweet malt evoking flavours of honeyed flapjacks and home-made caramel squares, this is one for the sweet-toothed among you.While it\u2019s not often seen here in the UK, Cardhu is the biggest selling single malt whisky in Spain, with its soft, sweet character the perfect match for the warm climate.Cardhu 12 is the perfect drink for the summer \u2013 it's great on its own, but why not try it with a block of ice, or served long with a splash of water, mizuwari style.San Francisco World Spirits Competition 2011 \u2013 Double GoldInternational Spirits Challenge 2014 \u2013 Silver Medal","14686":"An unusual 1980s bottling of Cardhu 12yo.","1470":"A bottling of 1973 vintage Cardhu released as part of Diageo's Rare Malts range around the turn of the millenium. A 27 year old dram bottled at a fairly fierce 60.02% ABV.","1483":"The Speyside representative of the Classic Malts series is rich and spicy, with a very satisfying complexity and well-sherried backbone.","1485":"A small bottle of Cragganmore's excellent 12 year old, perfect for sampling or filling a hip flask","14879":"Formerly a travel retail exclusive, the popularity of the Triple Wood has led to it being launched into the general market. The whisky starts off maturing in regular bourbon casks, before being moved to Laphroaig's bespoke quarter casks for a time. The whisky is then finished in oloroso sherry casks to gently sand off any remaining sharp edges.","14902":"This is a cask-strength edition of the wonderful Port Askaig 19 Year Old, bursting with fabulously flinty, lemony, seashells-on-the-seashore flavours. Although the alcoholic strength has only gone up by around 4%, the result is a noticeable jump in intensity. A truly elemental whisky, perfect for swigging from hip flasks during cold winter walks.Awarded Malt of the Month December 2014","15037":"A 75cl version of the presentation of Royal Lochnagar's prestigious Selected Reserve, which was phased out around 2008.

As such, the item is sold as described.","15098":"Another entry in The Glenrothes' excellent range of vintages, distilled in 1995 and bottled 19 years later in 2014.","15253":"An update to the much vaunted Bunnhabhain 25 year old, keeping the same age statement and presentation but upping the ABV to 46.3% to bring it line with the rest of the range. A great whisky at 43% but even better now with a little more oomph.","15308":"A 2011 release to fill a gap in the rapidly expanding Glendronach range and named for the Parliament of rooks that live in the trees near the distillery. A tasty combination of sherry matured whiskies, both Oloroso and PX, perfect for sherry-heads.","15324":"A special distillery bottling of Mortlach released for Scotland's Insider magazine.","15362":"A belated entry in Diageo's 2011 Special Releases selection, hitting the market in early 2012. Closed in 1985 and since demolished, whisky from the distillery is sought after by collectors and drinkers alike due to the comparatively small number of bottlings available. This 40 year old is one of the oldest we've seen, only beaten by the 2007 50 year old Special Release, and is sure to be popular amongst fans.","15377":"A 1949 vintage Glen Grant from independent bottlers Gordon & Macphail. One of the minority of distilleries in Speyside that can take extended cask maturation, we estimate this was bottled in the 1980s and is therefore well over 30 years old.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","15383":"Lagavulin's popular limited edition Distiller's Edition, distilled in 1995 and finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry casks. An extra layer of sweetness soothes the rough edges of this much-loved dram.","15548":"An old bottling of Laphroaig 10 year old whisky. We estimate this to have been bottled sometime during the early 1980s for the Italian market.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","15674":"A 1988 vintage from The Glenrothes, matured for almost 25 years before bottling. The palate has a silky mouthfeel with wonderful rich fruit and a weight and depth that belies its 43% bottling strength.","15703":"A malt whisky of unmistakable honey-rich maturity and depth. Glenlivet 18yo is the winner of two Gold medals in the International Wine and Spirit Competition (IWSC) and remains one of the best-value expressions of sherried Speyside.","15753":"Only the second official bottling of whisky from closed distillery Glenugie in recent times, following the previous 32 year entry with this 1980 vintage 30 year old. The distillery closed in 1983 and has since been demolished, and bottlings in general are quite rare.","16165":"A longer aged whisky from Cardhu, staying in the cask for 18 years for a richer and more complex flavour. The 18 Year Old retains Cardhu's soft, approachable style, but adds notes of rich fruit, leather and chocolate to the mix.","1619":"Caol Ila 12 Year Old is of medium weight, but still packing plenty of potent phenols, this is a refined, powerful dram with a compensating oiliness. A balanced, peaty beauty..","1624":"Extra ageing has calmed the impact of the phenols, with the peat arriving on the palate late, and tempered by smooth oak. A very mellow, mature Islay malt.","16252":"A special edition whisky from Ben Nevis in celebration of their 185th year. It is an attempt at recreating the McDonald's Traditional Ben Nevis which was a popular dram in the 1880s. IWSC 2012 - Gold Outstanding Medal - Whisky - Scotch ","1629":"Taking its name from the Gaelic for \u2018dawn\u2019, Moch is a wonderful newcomer from Caol Ila and is a must-try for fans of this outstanding distillery. Lighter in style than the standard 12yo expression, Moch is a fantastic easy-drinking dram. Caol Ila Moch is the first single malt from the distillery to be selected entirely on the basis of its taste, rather than age, cask wood, strength or finish.The nose is creamy and lemony, before a silky-smooth medium-bodied palate that still packs a peaty punch. The finish is dry, sooty and very more-ish.Moch was available initially only to the Friends of the Classic Malts exclusively from The Whisky Exchange. We think it's the best FOCM release in years and a very exciting addition to the Caol Ila family.","16364":"An entry in the latin(-ish) named range from Benriach, stepping up from their 10 year old Curiositas with a 17 year old version of their peated Speyside dram. They say it harks back to the older peaty styles of Speyside whisky, we just say it's rather tasty.","1665":"Clynelish is the successor to the now-silent Brora, built opposite the original distillery and producing a top-quality rich, smoky dram. One of the best entry-level proprietary bottlings available from any distillery.","16650":"The second coming of the Dalmore Cigar Malt, relaunched in an eye-catching red box. Fans of the previous edition will definitely want to get their hands on this.","1666":"A 17 year old Clynelish 'released' as a Manager's Dram. These whisky was selected by the manager and bottles were generally given to workers and friends of the distillery, meaning that they're rather good and not all that common.Please note: this bottle contains sediment.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","16805":"Glenfiddich's Malt Master Brian Kinsman was the first to double-mature a Glenfiddich whisky in two different casks (although shorter finishing periods in more than one kind of casks has of course been done several times before). This whisky has been matured for some time in traditional oak casks before finishing its maturation in sherry casks.","16821":"An interesting spicy dram from Glen Moray - a 10 year old whisky entirely matured in Chardonnay casks. The start of what we hope is a continuing line of new whiskies from this often overlooked distillery.","16932":"The Glenglassaugh Distillery was mothballed from 1986 until 2008 and this the first whisky to be made from spirit distilled at the distillery since it reopened. It was matured in a mixture of first and refill bourbon casks before a final 6 months finishing in first fill oloroso sherry butts.","17160":"A rare and impressive bottling by Gordon & Macphail under their mystery malt Macphail's label - a single malt whisky distilled back in 1945. Only a handful of distilleries where producing at this time, due to the Second World War, so we think it's likely that this is either Macallan or Glenlivet.","17353":"A half-bottle of Bowmore's 12-year-old whisky, a great place to start your journey through the smoky mystery of Islay's single malt whiskies. The current 12yo bottling is a welcome return to the classic Bowmores of the 1960s and '70s, with the emphasis on tropical fruit and smoke. A deserved runner-up in our Whisky of the Year 2014-15 blind tasting.","17392":" Another well-priced release from Gordon and Macphail - an early 1970s Linkwood bottled with the traditional old school label design.","17401":"A half bottle of Old Pulteney's reliable coastal 12 year old single malt whisky.","17485":"The 2011 bottling of Talisker's regularly appearing 30 year old whisky, bottled at the distillery's traditional strength of 45.8%.","17749":"The 1994-and-earlier 'vintage' edition of Macallan's iconic sherry cask 18 year old arrives as news sinks in of the discontinuation of age statements across most of the distillery's standard range. How much longer will these vintage 18yos continue to be produced?","178":"This lip-smacking 12yo AnCnoc (formerly Knockdhu) is a top-quality proponent of the non-sherried Speyside style, showing polished malt and a delicious spiciness throughout a warm, complex palate and lasting finish.","17831":"A fourth entry in the Diageo Special Releases range for Dalwhinnie, following on from a IWSC Best In Class winner. This time it's a 25 year old whisky distilled back in 1987.","17835":"A whopping 16th entry for Talisker in the annual Diageo Special Releases, this time the oldest bottling offered by the distillery so far - a 35 year old whisky, distilled in 1977 and matured in a mixture of refill American and European oak casks.","17955":"A no-age-statement release from Longrow. One of the three whiskies distilled at Springbank distillery, Longrow is generally peaty in comparison to its siblings. A well-balanced whisky with some slightly medicinal notes.","17985":"A 14-year-old limited-edition Balvenie which finished its maturation in casks which had previously held Caribbean rum. Expect vanilla and toffee notes as the rum contributes extra sweetness to the flavours.","18039":"The first edition of Old Ballantruan with an age statement, bottled after 10 years. It's made at Tomintoul using heavily peated barley and is bottled at a solid 50% ABV.","18089":"A much-loved single malt, Cardhu is an easy-going, charming Speysider.

Aged in a combination of first fill and refill sherry casks, it is designed to sit between the now-defunct 10yo Sherry Oak and 10yo Fine Oak bottlings.","18118":"A set of 20cl bottles showcasing the range of whiskies produced by Benromach. It features the Peat Smoke, 10 year old and their Special Edition Organic whisky.","1814":"Dalwhinnie 15yo is a good introduction to the delights of single malt whisky \u2013 elegant, smooth and medium-bodied, with a light, fruity palate and a whiff of heather on the finish. Part of Diageo's Classic Malt range.","1818":"One of the early Diageo Special Releases, this cask-strength Dalwhinnie was bottled in 2002. An intensely-flavoured dram, with natural honey and more than a whiff of smoke, this is the oldest-ever official expression of Dalwhinnie, and arguably the best.","18266":"The late 2012 release under Bruichladdich's Octomore label, peated to a fairly astounding 169ppm. Expect fire from the cask strength and lots of smoke, but also some elegance hiding behind the fireworks. As ever the producer's notes (below) are well worth a read.","18482":"A sweet and rounded 15 year old dram from Glengoyne, made using air dried barley and about as unsmoky as a whisky can get. It's a rich mix of 1st fill sherry and bourbon matured whisky, rounded out with some refill casks.","18483":"A replacement for Glengoyne's 17yo that appeared in their revamped range in late 2012. A mix of refill sherry casks and a generous slug of first-fill sherry-matured whisky.Awarded Malt of the Month - September 2014","18598":"Another incredibly priced retro-labeled old Longmorn bottled by Gordon & Macphail from their scarily well stocked warehouses - this one was distilled in 1967.","1863":"A delicious bottling from Dailuaine. Big, rich, sweet and smoky, with a very smooth mouthfeel and plenty of fruits and spices.","18722":"A 1968 vintage Glen Keith, bottled by Gordon and Macphail for their Connoisseurs Choice collection.","18893":"A continuation on from Jura's 200th anniversary edition, well aged for 21 years and presented in a box with built in display plinth.","18952":"The 2013 release in Glenmorangie's annual Private Edition series of small batch wood experiments, Ealanta differs from its predecessors as it has been full-term matured (rather than finished) in its designer casks, which in this instance are made from heavily toasted new white oak.This is limited to 1 bottle per customerJim Murray's Best Whisky in the World 2014","1902":"A tiny distillery in Perthshire is home to Edradour, one of Scotland's most endearingly different malts. Delicious honey notes complimented by an oily mouthfeel and a stylish finish.","19132":"A delightful decanter containing 1953 vintage Glenfarclas. This bottling was released in 2013 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. A limited release of only 60 specially commissioned crystal decanters. The whisky matured in a single oak cask in Glenfarclas's cellars in Ballindalloch for almost six full decades before being bottled at its natural strength.

Paying homage to the Alt-na-Frith burn, from which the distillery derives its water, this single malt is weighty and oily, with notes of blood orange marmalade, marzipan and rich toffee.

PC, as it's known to its friends, is heavily peated to 40ppm, putting it up with Islay's other heavy hitters. The resulting whisky is big and peaty with a maritime tang \u2013 the Bruichladdich team would claim that it's because their warehouses are so close to the sea, we're still undecided. In the end, the most important thing is the taste: it's rather good.","43963":"A peaty whisky from Islay's Bruichladdich distillery, this 2011-vintage Port Charlotte was distilled entirely from grain grown on the island.

Each cask selected by Adam to be included in the mix is at least 26 years old, and the low natural cask strength of 46.9% suggests an aged elegance.

Rather than the full-on sherry monsters that Mortlach is better known for, this is a more complex take, with restrained sherry-cask notes and lots of Mortlach's rich and malty character. If you're a sherry fan, don't worry: there's still lots of rich fruit and raisins here, tempered by a touch of sultana and vanilla.","45163":"One of Bladnoch\u2019s first releases since coming under new ownership in 2015. On the palate, ripples of citrus and coconut merge with sweet oak spice, juicy gooseberry and light vanilla aromas. Non-chill-filtered and without added colour, the 10 Year Old has been crafted to present the distillery\u2019s definitive Lowland style and boy, are we glad it\u2019s back.","45221":"A rich and spicy dram from Tomatin, marrying together the distillery's fruity spirit with sweet Moscatel wine barriques. The whisky was distilled in 2003 and matured for about a decade before being reracked into Moscatel casks for a five-year long secondary maturation. The result is a well-balanced dram, with citrus and toasted spice layered against soft fruit and creamy notes.","45224":"So popular that Glenfiddich couldn't let it disappear \u2013 this is batch two of Winter Storm.

The first edition flew off the shelves, so don't delay on number two.","45248":"The third and final entry in the Bowmore Vintner's trilogy, bringing in Portugal's best-known wine export \u2013 Port. Matured for 13 years in ex-bourbon casks before being transferred to port pipes for a further 14 years, this whisky is complex and rich, marrying dried-fruit notes from the pipes with fresher toffee and caramel, and, of course, Bowmore's smoky and fruity character.

The result is a success, combining the best of both of these worlds while still showing off the meaty Mortlach spirit.","45300":"A rich and sherried expression from Mortlach that's will always be compared to the fan-favourite 16-year-old Flora & Fauna bottling. This is more balanced than that discontinued dram, with a mix of first-fill and refill sherry casks giving a wider range of sherry-cask character, from rich and dark dried fruit to plump and juicy berries.","45356":"The second release in Highland Park's Viking Legend series.

It has, however, gone through the same micro-maturation process as the first edition - one that sees the spirit first filled into smaller-than-average bourbon casks for six to nine months, a process which accelerates maturation before it is then transferred into more traditional casks for several years.Ailsa Bay Sweet Smoke has notes of damp heather, vanilla oak, creamy toffee and candied orange peel.","45722":"A 2018 bottling of Benromach's 2010 vintage Organic single malt. This is a classic Speysider: rich malt and subtle fruit integrate wonderfully with the woody spice and vanilla flavours of virgin oak maturation and later, bittersweet dark chocolate underlines an otherwise clean and vivacious whisky.","45820":"Something a little different from the team at Hidden Spirits \u2013 a 2007-vintage Dailuaine aged for 10 years, first in a bourbon cask and then in a cask that used to hold heavily peated whisky. It's a successful combination, with Dailuaine's weighty spirit holding together fruit, spice and a vein of peat smoke.","45887":"Inspired by Captain Bill Grant Smith, great grandson of Glenlivet's founder, Captain's Reserve is finished in casks that previously held Cognac \u2013 a process that creates distinctive notes of raisin and honey within this creamy, citrusy single malt.","45891":"Long cast only as an ingredient in blends, this single malt from Allt-a-Bhainne puts a peaty twist on the traditional Speyside profile to achieve a sweet, spicy and accessible malt with, as Allt-a-Bhainne themselves put it, 'just enough peat to start a fire'.","45923":"Made solely from barley grown on Irene's Farm in Islay (peated to 133 PPM) and aged for five years in mostly second-fill American whiskey barrels, this is a fascinating study of how a single-vintage low-yield harvest affects the whisky character. This has intense notes of malted barley, black tea, golden syrup, burning heather and smoke.The Octomore 9 series has been named dialogos (dialogue in ancient Greek) in recognition of the whisky's ability to provoke debate amongst whisky enthusiasts.","45925":"A youthful heavily peated Port Charlotte, distilled at Bruichladdich distillery from Scottish barley and matured in first-fill ex-American whisky casks and second-fill French wine casks before a final year of marrying in French oak. It's all about the influence of the wood, and the casks have added sweet citrus and dark chocolate notes to the rich and peaty spirit.","4594":"A set of three 20cl bottles comprising Speysider Cragganmore 12yo, powerfully peaty Lagavulin 16yo & the smoky, peppery Talisker 10yo from the Isle of Skye. Perfect for hip flasks.","45979":"A cask-strength version of The Arran's peated Machrie Moor single malt - a whisky crafted to encapsulate the rugged and myth-strewn landscape of the island of Arran. Bottled at 56.2%, the sharp citrus notes and brooding peat smoke last easily into the lingering finish.","45989":"Distilled in 2008 this whisky spent the last 2 years of its life aging in French brandy casks before being bottled at cask strength. This dram is packed with orchard fruits with an almost grapey backbone behind dried fruits and sweet caramel.","45996":"Batch 62 of the A'Bunadh range - small batch bottlings of oloroso-sherry aged single malt - continues with this 61st edition, which as usual offers tasty notes of dried fruit, sherry, dark chocolate and spice.","46056":"A beautifully-balanced Ben Nevis: bittersweet cocoa underlies a marvellously fruity profile full of sweet, ripe citrus aromas with spiced cereal notes throughout. A perfect example of an Old Particular, the refill hogshead maturation serves to raise up and frame the distillery's character. This is a great all-rounder of a whisky with plenty of complexity to dig into.","46090":"A litre bottle presented in a golden tin, Aberfeldy 12 is a fruity, clean and polished malt with a touch of honey and spice. An excellent introduction to this Highland distillery. Aberfeldy's main claim to fame is as the heart of the excellent Dewar's blend but whiskies like this are putting it firmly in the spotlight.","4617":"Pretty much the only expression of Speyburn on the market until 2008. The 10 year old may now have stable mates but it still keeps its place as the easy drinking centre of the range. Speyburn continues to gather quiet momentum in the wake of updated packaging and 2012's shock World Whisky Award win for the 25 year old.","46175":"A fresh and airy Tomatin bottled as the third instalment in the 'Bourbon' segment of Gordon & MacPhail's Discovery series, which curates and colour-codes whiskies to guide people through three of Scotch whisky tasting's primary pillars: 'Sherry,' 'Bourbon' and 'Smoky'.

We love Edradour's big sherried drams, and this one was a must-have as soon as we tried it \u2013 we bought the whole cask. It was distilled back in 2005 and matured for 12 years in a very active oloroso sherry butt before bottling in March 2018. The cask has layered on the fruit and spice, with intense sherry notes rolling out of the bottle as soon as you pull the cork. A friendly monster.","46251":"The Speyside entry in the Millennial Range, Speyside Star is as 12-year-old whisky from an undisclosed distiller, specially selected to showcase the traditional regional character. It's got that in spades, with rich fruit and honey running right through its heart. A classic Speysider from one of the most exciting new bottlers in Scotland today.","46252":"A single-cask single malt from an unnamed Highland distillery, bottled by Glasgow indies North Star at 11 years old. A great-value dram for those who want something heavier than a Speyside but less smoky than an Islay.","46253":"A single-cask single malt from an island somewhere off the coast of Scotland - we could tell you where, but that would be orkward. Aged for ten years, this has notes of malt, orange and a wisp of smoke.","4642":"A cask strength 1960s Springbank bottled by Ian Macleod for their Chieftain's Choice series, this is a bargain when you look at how much official Springbanks from the same era go for these days.","46478":"A limited-edition release of Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask, with a gift tin featuring a photograph of a cask by Magnum photographer Alex Soth.

Ledaig is the name the distillery gives to its smoky spirit, and this release was distilled back in June 1997 and bottled in August 2018 at 21 years old from a single refill hogshead. It's a bit of a bruiser, although 21 years in cask have softened the maritime kick a tad, focusing things on its rich, meaty and smoky core.","4672":"Blended from a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks, the light colour of this malt belies the richness of its character. The nose has a wide range of aromas, from citrus fruits to pears and a hint of peat, while the palate shows touches of smoke, vanilla essence, nutmeg, cinnamon and the salty tang characteristic of the distillery. Picked up the top prize in its category at the World Whiskies Awards 2014.","46869":"A punchy cask-strength limited-edition version of Speyside distillery's Spey Tenn\u00e9. As you can tell from the colour, it's been finished for size months in tawny port casks, adding a layer of sweet berry fruit flavour to the big, rich dram, amplified further by bottling at full strength.","46898":"The 2018 edition of Kilkerran's small batch 8-year-old cask-strength whisky. It's matured in bourbon casks and bottled without chill-filtration to keep as much of the whisky's character intact. It's a rich and gently smoky dram, with balanced sweetness and fruit.","46899":"A very popular Highland dram, with a big sherry presence alongside sweet citrus fruit notes and a faint whiff of brine. Picked up the top prize in its category at the World Whisky Awards 2010.","47086":"Our second exclusive release in the shiny, revamped Connoisseurs Choice range from Gordon & MacPhail: a 2004-vintage, sherry-matured, single-cask Glenturret. It's spent its life in a refill sherry hogshead, but don't let the 'refill' part of that fool you \u2013 there's more than a bit of sherry influence here. Rich and spicy with stacks of juicy berries and raisins, it's the perfect winter dram.","4733":"A legendary dram.

A malt that approaches perfection.Please note: this bottle contains sediment.","4763":"The now discontinued 8 year old whisky from one of Scotland's youngest distilleries. They started production in 1990 after over 25 years of building (a lot by hand) and have now been around long enough to have a 12 year old as their standard bottling.","4815":"A lovely old bottle of 1953 Talisker bottled, we estimate, in the 1970s by Gordon & Macphail. These bottles are highly prized by malt aficionados and are extremely difficult to find nowadays.Please note: this bottle contains sediment.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.","4837":"A massive success as the island representative in Diageo's 'Classic Malts' series, Talisker 10yo's profile keeps increasing as more fans discover its intense coastal spicy, peaty character. A truly elemental malt.Always a benchmark. 90 points \u2013\u00a0 Serge Valentin, whiskyfun.com","4838":"The perfect stocking-filler, and something any true malt fan would love to find in their hipflask - or a little treat for yourself? Brimful of coastal power and elegance, with the hallmark chilli and white pepper notes tantalising the tastebuds.","4843":"Widely regarded as one of the finest Taliskers ever released, garnering 95 points from Jim Murray and the comment 'Miss this and your life will be incomplete'. Simply stunning.","4851":"Released in 2004, this beautifully orchestrated Talisker 25yo has a full, generous palate, with hot spices balanced by delicious shortbread & syrupy notes. A really awesome malt from a remarkably reliable distillery.","4937":"The first bottling of Tomintoul to be released after it changed hands in 2000, it's a rounded dram with fruit and toffee, and a peppery finish.","4938":"Long known as 'the gentle dram' Tomintoul 16yo is soft and nutty, with a pleasant richness. A Gold Medal winner at the International Wine & Spirits Competition (IWSC), this is a cracking dram for the money.","4943":"A very clean, grassy, medium-bodied Highlander with a predominantly malty character. A real charmer, this is a great introductory malt.","5258":"An excellent value 21yo Aberfeldy, showcasing the richer end of the Highland spectrum with plenty of sherry influence. Winner of a Gold Medal and Best in Class at the International Wine & Spirits Competition 2010.","5267":"Airigh Nam Beist 1990 is a delicious vintage bottling from the ongoing success story that is Ardbeg. Sadly now discontinued due to exhausted stocks, 'the Beist' was an extremely popular Ardbeg, with assertive and powerful peatiness and a lovely honeyed edge. Oh, and it's pronounced 'Arry nam Baysht'.","5300":"A 20cl bottle of Balvenie's popular 12 Year Old DoubleWood. The double maturation by finishing in first-fill European oak sherry casks adds complexity. The first maturation softens and adds character, with the finishing in sherry casks adding depth and fullness of flavour.","5355":"A 37 year old release of Bowmore, distilled in 1968 and bottled at a cask strength of 43.4%. A limited edition bottling that looks to have been the marriage of just 4 or 5 bourbon casks, it's gone down as one of the greats from this golden decade of production.","5431":"A quarter bottle of Dalwhinnie 15yo, the Highland representative in Diageo's Classic Malts series. Dalwhinnie 15yo is a good introduction to the delights of single malt whisky - elegant, smooth and medium-bodied with a light, fruity palate and a whiff of heather on the finish.","5559":"The oldest official Lagavulin ever released, this caused a storm when it came out a couple of years ago.","5586":"A young and peaty single malt whisky from an unnamed Islay distillery, this has garnered praise for its straight-to-the-point smoky flavour.","5747":"Bowmore 12yo has a place in many hearts as Islay's 'medium-peated' malt. A pronounced iodine character with plenty of pepper, the current 12yo bottling is a welcome return to the classic Bowmores of the 1960s and '70s, with the emphasis on tropical fruit and smoke. A deserved runner-up in our Whisky of the Year 2014-15 blind tasting.","5783":"A snazzy bottling of 1987 vintage Glenmorangie with a fancy box and some time finishing in casks that previously held wine from chateau Margaux. A must for collectors of Glenmorangie.","5850":"A fruity, clean and polished malt with a touch of honey and spice, Aberfeldy 12 Year Old is an excellent introduction to this Highland distillery. Aberfeldy's main claim to fame is as the heart of the excellent Dewar's blend but whiskies like this are putting it firmly in the spotlight.","5861":" A whisky coming into its prime. This 15-year-old single malt, which spends its final three years in oloroso sherry casks, is elegantly balanced between this sherry influence and the distillery's fruit and peat characteristics \u2013 including a siren-like whisper of tropical fruit that will delight fans of older-style Bowmore. Now is the time to try Bowmore 15 Year Old, which reflects the best of the distillery's output from around the new millennium.","5862":"A popular expression in Bowmore's ongoing range, this replaced the 17 year old, which was phased out a few years ago. Fresh, with notes of salty kippers and coal smoke.","5950":"Following on from Very Young and Still Young, Ardbeg Almost There showed the final stage in the evolution of young cask-strength Ardbeg 1998 before it blossomed into the Renaissance 10 yr-old. As you would expect, this is a mellower, more rounded, better balanced dram than the younger incarnations.","5981":"One of the legendary Bowmore bicentenary releases, bottled in 1979 as part of their 200th birthday celebrations. Distilled in the 1960s and matured in some rather excellent sherry casks this is still considered to be one of the best Bowmores ever produced.","6":"A very rare 1980s release of 15 year old Aberfeldy, bottled by the distillery.Please note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle.

This version of Provenance was for the US market and was introduced in 2000.","6297":"A long-aged distillery-bottled Bowmore, a large proportion of the casks used to assemble this 25yo are ex-sherry, giving sweetness and depth to this complex, fruity Islay malt.","6477":"A 1970 vintage single cask Glenfarclas from the Scotch Malt Whisky Society, bottled in February 1998 at 27 years of age.

This smooth, mellow dram is designed to attract new drinkers to the malt category.","6737":"The 2016 re-release of the much-missed Highland Park 15 Year Old. Aged in sherry casks, this is rich and initially sweet before a dry smokiness comes to the fore.","6793":"A massive 4.5 litre bottle of cask strength 10 year old Ardbeg, bottled as 'MOR' (this was the original MOR bottling). A serious bit of kit that will take up a chunk of space and provide a talking point at whisky related gatherings for years to come. Lifting it to pour a dram may require help.","690":"The Rare Malts are a now-discontinued series of cask-strength releases designed by Diageo to showcase some of the hidden treasures in their portfolio. This particular dram is all the more precious for having come from a distillery closed in 1983 and now sadly demolished.","6941":"Highland Park 12 Year Old remains one of the gold- standard malts for other distillery bottlings to aspire to. With a delicious sweetness (heather-honey is their preferred description) and a warming, silky mouthfeel, this is a whisky that never lets you down. \"The greatest all-rounder in the world of malt whisky\". Michael Jackson, Michael Jackson's Malt Whisky Companion","6942":"The 2017 relaunch of one of our all-time favourites, this has to be one of the most consistently excellent malt whiskies of the past 10 years.

Unfailingly excellent, especially after a good meal.Pacult wrote: 'After 25 years' experience, it fits my profile of what makes a perfect whisky, which is to say it's totally in harmony, there are no rough edges and everything is melded together brilliantly.'","697":"Curiositas is the hugely popular 10 year-old peated malt from the recently-revitalised Benriach distillery. One of the few overtly peated Speyside malts, and definitely one to try for phenol fans.","6992":"The 6th bottling of Brora 30yrs from Diageo is another classic 1970s-style Brora, and standards are just as high as ever, with overt citrus and medicine cabinet notes. This is yet another fabulous release from this much-lamented extinct distillery, scoring 93 points from Whiskyfun's Serge Valentin.","6999":"A 20cl bottle of Lagavulin 16 year old. Arguably the most pungent in terms of pure peat of all the Islay whiskies, it is rich and complex.","7001":"A legendary Lagavulin, originally released in 2007 - and it's to be the last fully sherried release, we're told. Boasting 95 points on Whiskyfun, this has become incredibly sought-after.","7032":"Replacing the 10 year-old as the main expression of the Lowland style in the Classic Malts range, this Glenkinchie 12yo is a bit fuller and more complex.","7033":"A super-premium entry in Glenlivet's range, this has been finished for a couple of years in Oloroso casks - so an extra depth of flavour and silky sweetness is the order of the day.\"The Oloroso Sherry influence meshes beautifully with The Glenlivet\u2019s signature sweet, floral, honey and malt notes, giving a nutty spiciness and quite intensely fruity palate, with raisins to the fore.

The result is a whisky with a combination of sweetness and rich, sherried flavours.","7218":"A favourite expression in the Dalmore stable, this 15-year-old is elegant and smooth, with lipsmacking texture and the flawless balance one would expect from blending maestro Richard Paterson.","73":"A tad less peaty than early bottlings, the classic Ardbeg 17yo is still a great whisky, but is sadly becoming very thin on the ground as demand increases and supply runs low - it's now a good few years since owners Glenmorangie discontinued it. The first bottling of this sparked the revival of Ardbeg's fortunes after the takeover by Glenmorangie.

As such, the item is sold as described.","7505":"A peated Speysider from Tomintoul, this has been bottled at 50% abv and at this price is well worth a look for peatheads looking for something a bit different.","7538":"We assume that this new no-age-statement peated Tomintoul must be similar to the Old Ballantruan but at a reduced strength. Either way, at this price it must be worth a punt for peatheads.","7627":"Ahh, the sting of seaspray, the tarry rope, the spice, the kippers for breakfast, the comforting reek of peat! Ignore all the hype and treat yourself to three of Diageo's finest - perfect hipflask fuel for a walk down the shore.","7635":"The return of the name Reserva to Glenfiddich's 21yo after a few years under different titles is also accompanied by an upgrade to its packaging.

This has been specially selected by Dr. Lumsden and should be a belter. Normally only available at the distillery.","7934":"Ardbeg Renaissance is the end of the series that began with the 'Very Young' 6yo which now changes hands for silly money on eBay. This is the first 10-year old Ardbeg that is entirely comprised of spirit produced after Glenmorangie's takeover of the distillery in 1997.

Trivia snitched from the Malt Whisky Yearbook: Deanston is the only distillery in Scotland that is self-sustaining for electricity, being equipped with a dam and a turbine.","9210":"A distillery-bottled cask strength Talisker, 57\u00b0 North is deceptively smooth for a whisky at this strength, but still a muscular presence on the palate, with the pepper and chilli Talisker hallmarks very much in evidence. Picked up the top prize in its category (Best Island No Age) at the World Whisky Awards 2012.","9389":"The initially controversial 16yo official expression of Scapa is now winning people round with a jump in quality after a few wobbly years following the rapid transition from the much-loved 12yo via the short-lived 14yo. Orkney's less shouted about (but still lovely in its own way) malt whisky has found its feet.","9398":"The new Glencadam 10yo, released at the end of 2008 by (relatively) new owners Angus Dundee. This is styled as 'The Rather Delicate Highland Malt'. Unchilfiltered, with no colouring and bottled at 46% - this is what we like to see.","9408":"Glencadam 15 has gone from strength to strength since a packaging facelift in 2009, at which time the strength was upped to 46% by owners Angus Dundee, who took over the distillery from Allied in 2003.
