Now all you need to do is persuade the recipient to share those 'golden moments' with you.\n","259":"\n The only distillery bottling of Glenlossie, other than a Manager's Dram. Almost all of their whisky goes into Diageo's blends, which is a shame as this is a classic spicy Speysider.\n","260":"\nThe first edition of Old Ballantruan with an age statement, bottled after 10 years. It's made at Tomintoul using heavily peated barley and is bottled at a solid 50% ABV.\n","261":"\nA distillery-bottled Balblair from the 2003 vintage. Long known to blenders as a category 'A' malt, Balblair was relaunched in 2007 and releases whiskies by vintage rather than by age.\n","262":"\nKnow someone that loves Islay whisky? This pretty gift pack should be just the thing for them, containing as it does two small (20cl) bottles of Kilchoman's celebrated single malts.  Sanaig is aged in both bourbon and sherry casks and has notes of toffee, smoke plums and dried fruit, while Machir bay is aged in bourbon and finished in sherry casks for a tempting combination of peat and sweetness.\n","263":"\nInspired by Captain Bill Grant Smith, great grandson of Glenlivet's founder, Captain's Reserve is finished in casks that previously held Cognac \u2013 a process that creates distinctive notes of raisin and honey within this creamy, citrusy single malt.\n","264":"\nMannochmore's delicate and fragrant entry into the Flora and Fauna range. One of the only bottlings you'll find with their name on the front.\n","265":"\nReleased in late 2010, this Arran 14yo is intended to be the standard issue bottling, taking over from the 12yo that appeared in late 2008. As has always been the case with Arran's malt, this has been neither coloured nor chill-filtered and has been bottled at a sensible drinking strength of 46%, for which the management deserve maximum kudos.\n","266":"\nLongmorn The Distiller's Choice is aged in a combination of hogsheads, sherry casks and bourbon barrels. A sweet and spicy whisky with notes of ginger and toffee.\n","267":"\nThe 2010 vintage of Bruichladdich Islay Barley comes from Optic and Oxbridge barley grown by eight farmers across Islay.

Each of the five bottlings, all in editions of 6,000 bottles, focuses on different cask maturations.\n","272":"\nThe fifth and final bottling in Tomatin's Five Virtues series. Paying homage to the Alt-na-Frith burn, from which the distillery derives its water, this single malt is weighty and oily, with notes of blood orange marmalade, marzipan and rich toffee. It is an equal marriage of whisky matured in sherry butts and that matured in second-fill ex-bourbon barrels.\n","273":"\nThe Western Highland representative in Diageo's 'Classic Malt' series, Oban 14yo is a superb, full-blooded fruity malt with a whiff of heather and more than a hint of smoke.\n","274":"\nA very clean, grassy, medium-bodied Highlander with a predominantly malty character. A real charmer, this is a great introductory malt.\n","275":"\nA 15 year-old expression of Singleton of Dufftown, Diageo's easy-drinking Speysider. This is a mix of European and American oak casks, producing a smooth, sweet, approachable style and a spicy, drying finish.\n","276":"\nThe entry point of the Mortlach range, combining both ex-bourbon- and ex-sherry-matured whisky to balance the distillery's traditionally weighty, dried fruit character against fresh fruit and vanilla notes. The result is a success, combining the best of both of these worlds while still showing off the meaty Mortlach spirit.\n","277":"\nA Hepburn's Choice bottling of whisky from Loch Lomond distillery. Inchfad is the name that is given to one of Loch Lomond's heavily-peated styles of whisky and it's rarely seen as a single malt whisky. This independent single-cask release was distilled in 2005, aged for 13 years and bottled in 2018. It's a sweet and smoky dram, with layers of vanilla and soft spice from the cask.\n","278":"\nPort Charlotte Scottish Barley is made from 100% Scottish-grown barley, peated to 40ppm which is then trickle distilled and combined with pure Islay spring water prior to bottling.

Married in a French-oak marrying vat, this is rounded and smoky with notes of toffee, aniseed, date and banana.\n","282":"\nPunch and smoky Nadurra from Glenlivet. The smoke doesn't come from the barley but from the casks \u2013 they were previously filled with peaty whisky, and refilled with Glenlivet. This gives the whisky a gentle smokiness, quite difficult to a regular peated whisky. It's also bottled, like the whole Nadurra range, at cask strength, giving it an intense character, run through with smoke.\n","283":"\nThe gateway to Gordon & MacPhail's excellently selected whiskies, the Discovery range offers dependable drams that dig deep into the world of Scotch whisky. This 12-year-old Balblair is the flagship of the Bourbon section of the range, with the distillery's trademark honeyed and fruity character amplified by American-oak ex-bourbon casks.\n","284":"\nOne of the starting points for whisky fans digging into Gordon & MacPhail's whiskies, the Discovery range is all about pulling apart the flavours of Scotland.

PC, as it's known to its friends, is heavily peated to 40ppm, putting it up with Islay's other heavy hitters. The resulting whisky is big and peaty with a maritime tang \u2013 the Bruichladdich team would claim that it's because their warehouses are so close to the sea, we're still undecided. In the end, the most important thing is the taste: it's rather good.\n","286":"\nThe final entry in the first batch of cask-strength releases from the Speyside distillery. Spey Fumare is the distillery's smoky whisky and the extra strength of this bottling lets the fruity and peaty character shine \u2013 intense and smoky with herbal hints.\n","287":"\nAn 11-year-old Speyside single malt distilled at Glenlivet and bottled by Signatory Vintage for the Un-Chillfiltered Collection.

The palate gives toasted barley flavours with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, orchard fruits and a hint of citrus.\n","288":"\nThe Flora and Fauna release of 10 year old Auchroisk. Until the 2010 release of a 20 year-old, this was the only generally available distillery bottling from this young distillery.\n","289":"\nA set of three 20cl bottles comprising Speysider Cragganmore 12yo, powerfully peaty Lagavulin 16yo & the smoky, peppery Talisker 10yo from the Isle of Skye.

Bottled at 56.2%, the sharp citrus notes and brooding peat smoke last easily into the lingering finish.\n","293":"\nA very interesting dram, the only Speysider to be triple-distilled like a Lowland malt or Irish whiskey, but with a lot more body and character than either of those styles. Impressive stuff.\n","294":"\nA distilery bottling of eight year old whisky from Glen Moray, bottled in the 1990s.\n","295":"\nThe only generally available distillery bottling from Inchgower, usually a key part of the Bell's blend. It's also not one that independents see much of, so this is one of your only chances to try the output from this quietly elegant distillery.\n","296":"\nThe now discontinued 8 year old whisky from one of Scotland's youngest distilleries. They started production in 1990 after over 25 years of building (a lot by hand) and have now been around long enough to have a 12 year old as their standard bottling.\n","297":"\nA sophisticated single malt from the Tobermory distillery, which is based on the Isle of Mull.

It was then married in a solera vat. A soft and spicy whisky.\n","301":"\nAfter the success of Cu Dhub, the black whisky made at Speyside for Danish bottler Mac Y, the distillery has decided to launch its own version. Beinn Dubh translates as 'black mountain'.\n","302":"\nMacallan 12 Year Old Double Cask has been aged in a combination of American oak and ex-sherry casks. This is a rich whisky which combines fruity citrus and caramel with spicy ginger and nutmeg.\n","303":"\nThe Art of Whisky Malting is the first in the Art of Whisky series, which was created exclusively for the Whisky Show 2017 and features label designs by our Creative Director Raj Chavda.

Not only does it display the PPM (Phenol Parts per Million) of the actual whisky on the bottle, but it also provides a figure for SPPM: Sweet Parts Per Million. The latter is a revolutionary method for measuring a whisky's sweetness, designed by master blender Brian Kinsman.

It has, however, gone through the same micro-maturation process as the first edition - one that sees the spirit first filled into smaller-than-average bourbon casks for six to nine months, a process which accelerates maturation before it is then transferred into more traditional casks for several years.Ailsa Bay Sweet Smoke has notes of damp heather, vanilla oak, creamy toffee and candied orange peel.\n","366":"\nThe inaugural release from Mossburn's Vintage Casks range \u2013 a 2007 Linkwood. This is a pure insight into Linkwood's distillery character, with the small batch wholly matured in hogsheads before bottling in November 2017 at ten years old.\n","367":"\nThe second release as part of Mossburn's Vintage Casks range is a Inchgower 2007. A lesser-know coastal Speyside distiller, this is a rare chance to taste its whisky. This small batch was matured in hogsheads for 10 years before bottling November 2017.\n","368":"\nDistilled in 2008 this whisky spent the last 2 years of its life aging in French brandy casks before being bottled at cask strength. This dram is packed with orchard fruits with an almost grapey backbone behind dried fruits and sweet caramel.\n","369":"\nA litre bottle presented in a golden tin, Aberfeldy 12 is a fruity, clean and polished malt with a touch of honey and spice. An excellent introduction to this Highland distillery. Aberfeldy's main claim to fame is as the heart of the excellent Dewar's blend but whiskies like this are putting it firmly in the spotlight.\n","370":"\nThe third (fourth if you include Travel Retail exclusives) bottling as part of the collaboration between Knockdhu distillery and Scottish designer\/artist Peter Arkle. A vatting of Spanish ex-sherry butts and American ex-bourbon barrels, bottled non-chillfiltered with natural colour at 46%.\n","371":"\nReleased to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of Lagavulin distillery by John Johnston in 1816, this eight-year-old is big and smoky, with sweet spice that becomes apparent with a drop of water. Inspired by the visit of Alfred Barnard to the distillery in the 1880s when he tried an 'exceptionally fine' eight-year-old from the distillery, this is a fitting tribute for the milestone.\n","372":"\nOriginally released for travel retail, Tomatin 15 Year Old is light and fresh with notes of honey, toffee and spice. A superb easy-drinking whisky.\n","373":"\nA new sherry-led expression from Aberlour, Casg Annamh \u2013 Gaelic for 'rare cask' \u2013 isn't pulling any punches at 48% ABV. Triple matured in European oak ex-sherry, American oak ex-sherry and ex-bourbon casks, this is a bold, flavoursome and exceptionally balanced whisky full of fresh fruit, sherried nuttiness and woody spice.\n","374":"\nA sweet and fruity dram from Inchgower, perched above the town of Buckie on Speyside's northern coast. This Old Malt Cask bottling is a rare chance to try it, as it's rarely released as a single malt. Distilled in April 2008 and bottled in November 2018 at 10 years old from a single sherry hogshead, it's not as maritime as some releases, but is layered with rich fruit and toffee notes.\n","375":"\nReleased as part of the brand's relaunch in 2015, Glen Scotia 15 Year Old is matured in bourbon barrels. This has notes of ginger, vanilla, sea spray and spice.\n","376":"\nThe first batch from Benriach's cask-strength series has been bottled at 57.2%. Bottled almost straight from the cask, this shows off the distillery's spirit in its natural form. Notes of honey, vanilla, ginger and mixed fruit make this a very enjoyable dram.\n","377":"\nThe very first batch of Benriach's Peated Cask Strength series has been matured in a combination of oloroso-sherry and bourbon casks. Warming and toasty with notes of sweet toffee apples, nectarines, tablet and heather smoke.\n","378":"\nThe second edition of Benriach's Cask Strength whisky. Bottled at a punchy 60.6% ABV, it's a concentrated look at Benriach's core flavours. The combination of bourbon, sherry and virgin oak casks create a richly spicy dram draped with fresh and dried fruit.\n","379":"\nA relatively youthful Ben Nevis with a fresh, excitable profile to match. A sweet, outdoorsy nose beckons us into a sweet palate full of vanilla and cocoa flavours rooted in leafy loam. One of 399 bottles, this is essential Ben Nevis and a must for Highland whisky fans.\n","380":"\nPunchy batch strength whisky from Glenlivet, matured in first-fill oloroso casks for deep colour and loads of intense sherry-cask flavour. Big, spicy and fruity, this is a must for sherry heads.\n","381":"\nA delicious bottling from Dailuaine. Big, rich, sweet and smoky, with a very smooth mouthfeel and plenty of fruits and spices.\n","382":"\nA fine drop of Ardbeg bottled at cask strength. A marriage of Ardbeg from bourbon barrels and sherry butts which gives a sweet and smoky finish to this malt. Uigeadail is the loch from which all Ardbeg water flows. An absolutely stunning whisky, and following the demise of Airigh nam Beist, this probably represents the best value in the core range.\n","383":"\nThe seventh release of Glendronach Cask strength, going for the distillery's classic combination of PX and oloroso sherry casks. Bottled at 57.9%, it's an intensely flavoured whisky with stacks of dried fruit and spice \u2013 exactly what Glendronach fans clamour for.\n","384":"\nThe second release in Highland Park's Viking Legend series. Found upon the bodies of slain warriors and thought to invoke the presence of Odin himself, Valknut will transport you to a roaring longhouse feast with its woody, smoky and spicy character.\n","385":"\nA bottling Ardmore, part of the Mossburn Vintage Casks series. This is a small batch release, bringing together a small number of 2008-vintage casks of Ardmore's smoky spirit, bottled in November 2017 at 9 years old.\n","386":"\nA 10-year-old Craigellachie bottled by Mossburn for the Vintage Casks range. Distilled in 2007, this small batch is made up of hogsheads and was bottled in November 2017.\n","387":"\nMoine is the name of one of Bunnahabhain's smokiest spirit makes, and here it's aged into a peaty beast. Distilled on 16 September 2011 and bottled by The Ultimate on 1 May 2018 at six years old from a single hogshead. The years in wood have rounded off some of the spikier edges, but left a punchy and intensely smoky dram that shows why Bunnahabhain is increasingly picking up accolades for its peaty whisky.\n","388":"\nA limited-edition release of Macallan 12 Year Old Double Cask, with a gift tin featuring a photograph of a cask by Magnum photographer Alex Soth. Double Cask brings together two distinct styles of whisky from the distillery: American-oak sherry casks and European-oak sherry casks. The combination digs into the flavour profile of both different types of wood \u2013 bring a range of spice and fruity flavours \u2013 as well as rich sherry character.\n","389":"\nA 12-year-old Dailuaine bottled by the folks at Hunter Laing in honour of the 20th anniversary of the first Old Malt Cask bottling. Distilled in June 2006 and bottled in July 2018. Independent bottlings are the only way to try anything other than heavily-sherried Dailuaine, and this release shows a lighter side to the distillery, without losing its traditionally weighty character.\n","390":"\nThe unpeated edition in the second batch of octave-matured whisky from Glenglassaugh. Octaves are small casks holding just 65 litres of whisky and add loads of oaky flavour to its contents in just a short time. This release is a vatting of these tiny casks that previously held bourbon, Pedro Xim\u00e9nez and amontillado sherry, creating a complex, rich and nutty dram.\n","391":"\nAn 11-year independent bottling of cask-strength whisky from Craigellachie in the heart of Speyside. It was distilled on 23 October 2007 and bottled on 12 November 2018 from a single bourbon hogshead by AD Rattray. Craigellachie is known for its rich and meaty spirit and it comes through here, with the punchy cask strength giving it even more weight and intensity.\n","392":"\nAberfeldy 16 Year Old was released in 2015 as part of The Last Great Malts series. Matured in a combination of bourbon and sherry casks, this has lovely balance between sweetness and spiciness.\n","393":"\nA gift set containing a bottle of a sherry-finished Glenfiddich and a pair of glasses. Glenfiddich's Malt Master Brian Kinsman was the first to double-mature a Glenfiddich whisky in two different casks (although shorter finishing periods in more than one kind of casks has of course been done several times before). This whisky has been matured for some time in traditional oak casks before finishing its maturation in sherry casks.\n","394":"\n A whisky coming into its prime. This 15-year-old single malt, which spends its final three years in oloroso sherry casks, is elegantly balanced between this sherry influence and the distillery's fruit and peat characteristics \u2013 including a siren-like whisper of tropical fruit that will delight fans of older-style Bowmore. Now is the time to try Bowmore 15 Year Old, which reflects the best of the distillery's output from around the new millennium.\n","395":"\nA litre bottle of Glenfarclas 105. Bottled at 60% abv, yet the sweet, rich, spicy distillery character is still very much in evidence. Just a few drops of water are recommended to open up the flavours.\n","396":"\nThe Islay representative in the 'Classic Malts' series is a deep, dry and exceptionally peaty bruiser. Probably the most pungent of all Islay malts, Lagavulin is not for the faint-hearted but inspires fanatical devotion in its many followers. Runner Up in TWE's Whisky of the Year 2014\n","397":"\nA 2000 vintage Aultmore bottled by Gordon & Macphail as part of their Connoisseurs Choice range. This was bottled two years after Diageo sold the owning company of the distillery to Bacardi in a deal worth more than \u00a31bn. Aged in refill sherry casks, this has notes of spice, wood and herbs.\n","398":"\nA 1999 vintage Glenallachie, whose whisky almost all goes into the Chivas Brothers blends. This was aged in a refill bourbon cask, being bottled in 2015 by Gordon & MacPhail for the Connoisseurs Choice series.\n","399":"\nA complex dram that does even more than its name suggests. Matured in a combination of seven different types of oak \u2013 first bourbon and then a finish in each of Vosges, Jupilles, Les Bertranges, Allier, Tron\u00e7ais, and Limousin casks. The result is spicy but run through with chocolate and fruit, thanks to wide range of flavours from the casks.\n","400":"\nBalvenie produces peated whisky for one week a year \u2013 named 'Peat Week'. This inaugural release is from 2002 and has been aged in American oak for 14 years. The result is a gently smoky whisky with notes of citrus, vanilla and blossom honey.\n","401":"\nA bold, creamy 15-year-old whisky from Speyside's Speyburn distillery, matured in both American and Spanish oak casks.\n","402":"\nThe 2007 edition of a much-loved release from Talisker. The Distillers Edition series adds a fruity and sweet layer to Talisker's classic maritime, smoky character, resulting in a complex and decidedly moreish whisky. The extra layer comes from the whisky being finished in casks that previously contained amoroso, a sweetened and fortified Spanish wine similar to sweet oloroso sherry in style.\n","403":"\nOne of Bladnoch\u2019s first releases since coming under new ownership in 2015. On the palate, ripples of citrus and coconut merge with sweet oak spice, juicy gooseberry and light vanilla aromas. Non-chill-filtered and without added colour, the 10 Year Old has been crafted to present the distillery\u2019s definitive Lowland style and boy, are we glad it\u2019s back.\n","404":"\nIndie Benriach from the chaps at That Boutique-y Whisky Company, with notes of hazelnuts, burnt sultanas, orange peel and barrel char. It comes with a label which references the distillery's malting floor, and the 'monkey shoulder' that those who had to turn the barley on this floor invariably developed.\n","405":"\nA single-cask Mortlach bottled by Hunter Laing for the Old Malt Cask 20th Anniversary range. The single refill cask only yielded 442 bottles of very untypical Mortlach \u2013 this is no sherry monster like so many releases from the distillery are, showing the other side to Mortlach's weighty spirit.\n","406":"\nA single-cask Glentauchers bottled by North Star Spirits for its 6th batch of whiskies. It was distilled in March 2008 and matured for 10 years, including a finish in a Bordeaux barrique. The wine cask has definitely had an effect, adding rosy notes and br\u00fbl\u00e9e notes to the already rich whisky.\n","407":"\nAward-winning, sherry-matured single malt from Tamdhu, this is the third edition in the Speyside distillery's Batch Strength Series. Vanilla and berry fruit begin proceedings, followed swiftly by sherry-oak spice and dried fruit lightened with a sharp citrus twang \u2013 all backed up by a hefty 58.3% ABV.\n","408":"\nGlencadam 15 has gone from strength to strength since a packaging facelift in 2009, at which time the strength was upped to 46% by owners Angus Dundee, who took over the distillery from Allied in 2003. An undersung distillery that is now starting to stretch its wings with some very good value for money whiskies. Shortlist for TWE's Whisky of the Year 2013\n","409":"\nAn, unsurprisingly, amber-coloured dram from Macallan, part of the colour-named 1824 Series. It's matured in sherry casks and chosen to be more fully flavoured than the Gold but more restrained than the Sienna. A great example of what Macallan can do with good-quality oak.\n","410":"\nHow to make a lightly peated whisky at Edradour? Combine one sherry butt of unpeated Edradour with three bourbon barrels of heavily peated Ballechin. Aged for eight years, this has notes of dark chocolate, praline and smoke.\n","411":"\nExclusive to The Whisky Exchange, this limited-edition Caol Ila was distilled in 2009 and bottled by Signatory.\n","412":"\nThe Cragganmore entry in Diageo's Distillers Edition series is one of the more unusual \u2013 it is finished in port pipes for extra sweetness and fruity depth. This is the 2005 vintage, bottled in 2017.\n","413":"\nA spell in casks previously containing sticky sweet Pedro Ximenez sherry has given this dram extra richness and intensified the fruity flavours, sprinkling them with a layer of spice. This Pedro Ximenez Sherry Wood Finish bottling is one of four released by the distillery in a series that, for the first time, explores the effect of wood finishes on their whiskies.\n","414":"\nGlenglassaugh describe this single malt as 'like a sweet shop by the beach', referring to the candy and vanilla notes added to their coastal, peated whisky by the American virgin oak it's been finished in.\n","415":"\nThe Bowmore Darkest has flourished since it gained a 15 year-old age statement. The sweet sherry notes take precedence over the peat here.\n","416":"\nWhile Balvenie is best known for producing traditional soft and honeyed Speyside whisky, for one week a year it makes bold and smoky whisky \u2013 Peat Week. This second release was distilled in 2003 and bottled in 2018 at 14 years old.\nThe distillery uses Speyside peat, giving the whisky a very different character to smoky drams from the island: delicate and gently smoky.\n","417":"\nThis 2004 Balmenach was aged for 13 years and displays aromas of creamy vanilla and caramel as well as herbs and candied orange peel and a hint of ginger.\n","418":"\nAn evolution of Macallan's 12 year old whisky, matured in a combination of sherry and bourbon casks.Whisky Bible Awards 2012: Best 11-15 year old Single Malt Scotch of the Year (multiple casks)\n","419":"\nMacallan 12 Year Old Double Cask has been aged in a combination of American oak and ex-sherry casks. This is a rich whisky which combines fruity citrus and caramel with spicy ginger and nutmeg.\n","420":"\nA 13-year-old Speyside single malt that's just peachy. Bottled by Hunter Laing from a single refill barrel that yielded just 264 bottles, this has notes of gingerbread, almonds and white pepper, alongside an abundance of ripe peaches. This bottling is a rare chance to try this distinctive single malt outside the blends for which it is so prized.\n","421":"\nThe little known Croftengea comes out of the Loch Lomond distillery and is a heavily peated malt normally used as a blending component. This 13yo comes from a single refill hogshead and was bottled without chill filtration. Granny Smith apple, almond and vanilla are just some of the notes in this whisky.\n","422":"\nAn 'explosive' limited-edition whisky from Smokehead, adding in a punch of sherry character to the anonymous peaty dram. It's matured in Oloroso sherry casks, fusing the big smoke with equally big sweetness and dried fruit notes.\n","423":"\nA 12-year-old Aultmore from Douglas Laing's Old Particular range. Distilled in July 2006 and bottled in September 2018 from a single refill hogshead at 12 years old. It's a crisp and fruity Aultmore, with orchard and citrus fruit backed up by spice.\n","424":"\nA single-cask whisky from Loch Lomond distillery, bottled as part of the Old Malt Cask series's 20th Anniversary range by Hunter Laing. Croftengea is the name that the distillery gives to its most heavily peated spirit, distilled in straight-necked stills. This is an excellent example, balancing punchy peat against fruity spirit.\n","425":"\nCooper's Reserve is a 14-year-old Auchentoshan released for travel retail. Aged in a combination of American bourbon casks and Spanish oloroso sherry casks, this is nutty with hints of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n","426":"\nBowmore Gold Reef was released for the travel retail market in 2014. A No Age Statement whisky that was matured predominantly in first fill ex-bourbon casks, this is a coastal whisky with tropical fruit flavours.\n","427":"\nWith a body and mouthfeel deserving of the moniker 'The Beast of Dufftown', though perhaps gentler in nature than the name suggests, this is a fresh and lively Mortlach full of sharp citrus notes, honey, spice and a hint of malty sweetness. More likely to lick your face than attack you, though still has a little bite at 48.4% ABV.\n","428":"\nThe third drawing of 'venom' from Blackadder's fourth Black Snake Vat. This is a vatting of casks which have been finished in a sherry butt \u2013 the Vat 4 of the name \u2013 which was not emptied entirely emptied when the last bottling \u2013 second venom \u2013 was drawn. Got that? Even if not, all you need to know is that it's an excellent sherry finished whisky bottled at cask strength.Please note Blackadder's Raw Cask series is unfiltered, and the bottles have a natural sediment.\n","429":"\nThe 20th anniversary bottling of Hunter Laing\u2019s Old Malt Cask range. A 12-year-old single malt distilled in 2006 and bottled in 2018 at 50% ABV. The nose is smoky and salty with hints of orange peel, oak and dark fruits. The palate carries weighty flavours of caramel, garden herbs and orchard fruits, before reaching a pleasantly dry finish.\n","430":"\nLaunched in 2016 as the third expression in Glenlivet's N\u00e0durra range, this has been finished in casks which used to hold peated whisky. Inspired by the original whisky from the distillery in the 19th century, which was peated, this has notes of vanilla, cream, and subtle smoke.\n","431":"\nA favourite expression in the Dalmore stable, this 15-year-old is elegant and smooth, with lipsmacking texture and the flawless balance one would expect from blending maestro Richard Paterson.\n","432":"\nThe peaty edition in the second batch of the Octaves series from Glenglassaugh. It's smoky spirit aged in a selection of tiny 65-litre octave casks, themselves made from casks that previously held bourbon, port and oloroso sherry. It's a rich and sweet dram with balanced savoury peat smoke.\n","433":"\nThis 2003 vintage Distillers Edition from Glenkinchie has been finished in Amontillado sherry casks for an extra burst of rounded flavour.

This was aged for more than a decade before being bottled in 2017.\n","436":"\nA well-balanced and nuanced Mortlach, selected and bottled by Gordon & MacPhail as part of the Distillery Labels range. Rather than the full-on sherry monsters that Mortlach is better known for, this is a more complex take, with restrained sherry-cask notes and lots of Mortlach's rich and malty character. If you're a sherry fan, don't worry: there's still lots of rich fruit and raisins here, tempered by a touch of sultana and vanilla.\n","437":"\nKnockando is known for its bottlings of vintage whiskies. This one was matured in ex-bourbon and -sherry casks and bottled in 2016 as part of the \u2018slowly matured\u2019 series.

This bottle comes in a unique wooden case, and was bottled at a punchy 57.3% ABV.

Non-chill filtered and without added colouring, this Speyburn\u2019s opening gambit is a flurry of late-summer nostalgia \u2013 sweet baked goods and fresh fruit sweep through the nose before doubling down on the palate to meld with a gentle, warming spice. A delightful expression of Speyburn spirit.\n","448":"\nA peaty whisky from Islay's Bruichladdich distillery, this 2011-vintage Port Charlotte was distilled entirely from grain grown on the island. The barley was harvested from three farms in 2010 and sent for malting on the mainland. When it returned, it was milled, mashed, fermented, distilled, matured and bottled all that distillery. The whisky combines the classic Port Charlotte peat smoke and citrus notes with creamy vanilla and coconut from the cask. An excellent look at the distillery's character and their dedication to the examination of terroir.\n","449":"\nA deliciously easy-going whisky, this organic 15-year-old is matured in American oak for gently-spiced and notably-honeyed profile. It begins in the nose, where citrus and oaky vanilla skitter down a slightly-floral honey slide.

This cask-strength small batch release was bottled in November 2017 at 10 years old.\n","451":"\nThe fourth entry in Mossburn's Vintage Casks range, a 10 year old Teaninich.

It's a beautifully light and fruity dram, balancing vanilla and toffee notes from the single bourbon cask it was matured in against the distillery's orchard fruit.\n","458":"\nSomething a little different from the team at Hidden Spirits \u2013 a 2007-vintage Dailuaine aged for 10 years, first in a bourbon cask and then in a cask that used to hold heavily peated whisky. It's a successful combination, with Dailuaine's weighty spirit holding together fruit, spice and a vein of peat smoke.\n","459":"\nEnjoy our 2018 Whisky of the Year, Bowmore 15 Year Old, from two handsome glasses thanks to this excellent gift pack.

The palate is filled with warming black pepper, oak, lemongrass and honey.\n","461":"\nA sherry-matured Dailuaine bottled by Douglas Laing for the Old Particular range. Distilled in July 2008 and bottled at 10 years old in July 2018 from a single sherry butt, it's a rich and spicy whisky, with Dailuaine's weighty spirit tamed by fruit and toffee notes.\n","462":"\nA travel retail exclusive, The Glenrothes Robur Reserve is named for Quercus Robur, the official name for European or Spanish oak, and contains a greater proportion of first-fill Oloroso sherry casks.\n","463":"\nDeceptively light to look at, this is a full-bodied brute of a Mortlach full of honey and baked goods, and wrapped all around with subtle, low spiciness. A full-blown symphony of Speyside sweetness and spice limited to 367 bottles.\n","464":"\nA 15-year-old expression of Old Balantruan, the peated line from Tomintoul distillery.

A whisky that never disappoints.\n","577":"\nPart of the Art of Whisky series created exclusively for Whisky Show 2017, this Miltonduff 17 Year Old carries a distinctive label representing the Art of Whisky Fermenting. The Speyside single malt inside has notes of sweet orchard fruits, buttery biscuit and tarte tatin.\n","578":"\nA single-cask Ballechin bottled at a cask-strength of 54.5% and exclusive to The Whisky Exchange, this heavily-peated single malt from Edradour distillery boasts a smoky, farmyard character to rival any Islay whisky. Balanced by sweet citrus and hints of honey, this is a fantastic dram which elegantly combines sweet, savoury and smoky notes to memorable effect.\n","579":"\nThe A'Bunadh range - small batch bottlings of oloroso-sherry aged single malt - continues with this 61st edition, which as usual offers tasty notes of dried fruit, sherry, dark chocolate and spice.\n","580":"\nA 10-year-old Croftengea bottled for Monnier Trading in Switzerland by Jack Wiebers as part of the Fighting Fish series. Croftengea is the name for heavily peated spirit distilled at Loch Lomond using straight-necked stills, and it doesn't get released as a single malt very often. This one was distilled in 2007 and bottled in 2017.\n","581":"\nAn 11-year old whisky selected and bottled by Italian independent Hidden Spirits. This was distilled in 2006 at Aultmore and bottled after 11 years of maturation, including a finish in Amarone wine casks. Bottled at cask strength, it's an intensely flavoured dram, carefully balancing Aultmore's herbal and grassy spirit against the power of the wine cask.\n","582":"\nItalian independent bottlers have released this cask-strength 10-year-old Ledaig expression from the Tobermory distillery, aged in bourbon barrels.\n","583":"\nA 15-year-old Macduff, bottled by Acorn \u2013 and indie bottler whose whiskies mainly stay in Japan. Macduff is one of Scotland's lesser-known distilleries, in part due to most of its whiskies being released under the name Glen Deveron, one of the pair of names it's alternated between since its 1960 founding. Distilled in November 2002 it was matured for 15 years in a hogshead before bottling in March 2018.\n","584":"\nBatch 62 of the A'Bunadh range - small batch bottlings of oloroso-sherry aged single malt - continues with this 61st edition, which as usual offers tasty notes of dried fruit, sherry, dark chocolate and spice.\n","585":"\nOban's 2003 Distillers Edition is, like all those before it, finished in casks that previously held fino from Montilla \u2013 the region whose wines rival the sherries from Jerez. Expect notes of light peat, light smoke and rich red fruits, accompanied by hints of orange, spice and brine.\n","586":"\nThe fourth and final bottling in Douglas Laing's Provenance Coastal Collection, celebrating Scotland's more maritime distilleries. This one is from Talisker, maybe the most iconic coastal producer, and was aged for eight years in a single refill hogshead \u2013 distilled in November 2009 and bottled in October 2018, just before its ninth birthday. It's a punchy and stereotypically 'islandy' dram, with crashing waves, sea spray and the classic Talisker salt and pepper running through its core.\n","587":"\nRoyal Brackla was the first distillery to be allowed to use the 'Royal' title, and 2015 saw it get its own range of single malts. Part of the Last Great Malts series, the 16 Year Old is finished in first-fill oloroso sherry casks and is sweet and spicy, with a hint of smoke in the mix, too.\n","588":"\nThis is the 2001 vintage of Lagavulin's Distillers Edition, bottled in 2017. By far the most popular of the series, this double-matured Lagavulin has had a finishing period in sweet, sticky Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry casks. A whisky that never disappoints.\n","589":"\nA 13-year-old entry in Glenallachie's first series of UK-exclusive single casks. The range was launched in celebration of the first year of operation under master blender Billy Walker, and he selected a range of casks to show off what his new distillery can do. This 2005-vintage Glenallachie was matured in a single bourbon barrel before bottling, and combines fresh citrus fruits with weightier and darker berry and stone-fruit character.\n","590":"\nA 199-vintage Teaninich bottled by Hunter Laing as part of the Old Malt Cask range's 20th Anniversary. This was distilled in July 1999 and bottled in August 2018 from a single refill cask at 19 years old. A classically grassy dram, with a solidly spicy backbone.\n","591":"\nWith new packaging for 2015, Inchmurrin 18 Year Old is a sweeter style of whisky from Loch Lomond. Richer than the 12 Year Old, this has floral and grassy notes.\n","592":null,"593":"\nA heavily-peated single-cask Arran bottled by The Whisky Agency for The Whisky Fair - a world-renowned annual event in Limburg, Germany.

Distilled in 2000 and bottled in 2018, it's a gently smoky dram with balanced sweetness.\n","596":"\nAn 11-year-old whisky from Deanston, a distillery which doesn't get many independent bottlings. Fortunately, Signatory Vintage have very well-stocked warehouses, and we now get to try this excellent first-fill-sherry-butt-matured dram. Distilled on 28 August 2006 and bottled on 25 January 2018 at 11 years old, it's bottled at a punchy 64.4% and is an intensely flavoured whisky, with lots of sherry cask influence.\n","597":"\nOnce a cotton mill, Deanston is now much better known as a producer of fine whiskies. This 11-year-old was bottled by Signatory Vintage for the Cask Strength Collection \u2013 distilled on 28 August 2006 and bottled from a first-fill sherry butt on 25 July 2018. This is a big dram, with its high strength and the first-fill maturation giving a big punch of sherry-cask character fruit and spice.\n","598":"\nExtra ageing has calmed the impact of the phenols, with the peat arriving on the palate late, and tempered by smooth oak. A very mellow, mature Islay malt.\n","599":"\nAn Cuan Mor (Gaelic for 'big ocean') is a travel retail bottling of Laphroaig. Aged in first-fill American white oak bourbon barrels, it is finished in European oak. Rich and spicy with a maritime character.\n","600":"\nThe sixth entry in Glenmorangie's Private Collection, showing off the distillery's experiments with different varieties of barley and named after the Gaelic word for 'originary' (an archaic form of 'originating'). Made using traditionally floor-malted Maris Otter barley, it's an old-fashioned whisky backed up by Glenmorangie's modern approach to whisky-making.\n","601":"\nThe 2016 re-release of the much-missed Highland Park 15 Year Old. Aged in sherry casks, this is rich and initially sweet before a dry smokiness comes to the fore.\n","602":"\nAnother edition of Clynelish for Diageo's yearly vintaged Distiller's Edition range. Clynelish's take on the series' 'Double Maturation' is to finish the whisky in oloroso sherry casks, to add an extra chunk of rich sweetness.\n","603":"\nA sherried release from Highland Park, Dark Origins is a combination of 80% first fill sherry casks (of which 60% is European oak and 20% American) and 20% refill sherry. A dark expression which fits in with the distillery's origins \u2013 founder Magnus Eunson being a smuggler who worked in the darkness of night.\n","604":"\nBacalta is the eight release in Glenmorangie's annual Private Edition series. Finished in casks which were seasoned with Malmsey Madeira, this is rich and fruity with notes of caramelised apricots, dates, almonds and honeycomb.\n","605":"\nThe 2017 release of Jura Tastival was aged initially in bourbon casks before being split into two. Half was finished in first-fill bourbon barrels and the rest in port pipes from Graham's. Rich and complex with notes of orange, pineapple, cassis and walnut.\n","606":"\nA single malt created by distillery manager, John Campbell, to honour the master craftsmen who have shaped Laphroaig over the past two centuries. This single malt was first left to rest in first-fill, over-charred ex-bourbon barrels, before being transferred to large, new European oak hogsheads \u2013 which have never been used by Laphroaig until now.The 1815 combines notes of peat smoke, toasted fruits and oiled wood.\n","607":"\nAn Old Particular bottling of Glenrothes from Douglas Laing. Distilled in March 2006, matured in a refill sherry butt for 12 years and then bottled in September 2018. The cask has added layers of rich spice, treacly sweetness and juicy fruit to the already weight Glenrothes spirit. Just the thing for sherry-cask fans.\n","608":"\nA 2003-vintage Benrinnes from Douglas Laing, bottled for the Old Particular range. Distilled in September 2003, matured in a single refill sherry butt and bottled in September 2018 at 15 years old. It's a rich and spicy sherried dram, the kind that Benrinnes is well known for. Chewy, fruity and very moreish.\n","609":"\nThe 18 year old has always been one of the best of Glenmorangie's core range and, in common with all Glenmo's offerings these days, it really looks the part. Picked up the top prize in its category at the World Whisky Awards 2010.\n","610":"\nA flavourful 18-year-old whisky from Glen Scotia, one of only three remaining distilleries in Campbeltown. This single malt, introduced in September 2017 and finished in oloroso sherry casks, offers abundant notes of sea spray, vanilla toffee and spiced fruits. The finish lingers, with spiced raisin and a touch of honeyed nuttiness.\n","611":"\nA young Caol Ila that packs a punch, this nine-year-old dram from Hidden Spirits\u2019 Young Rebels series has a beguiling combo of clean lemon citrus with aromatic peatsmoke, creating a robust whisky that still retains its freshness.\n","612":"\nA 2006-vintage whisky from Caol Ila, bottled for Carn Mor as part of the prestigious Celebration of the Cask bottling.

Only 450 numbered bottles were produced.\n","614":"\nA distillery release of 18-year-old Glencadam. Like most of the distillery's range this was bottled at 46%, and is a great addition to the Glencadam\u2019s malt family. This single malt delivers notes of spice, apples and pears and an exquisite chocolatey finish.\n","615":"\nA limited edition release from Glenfiddich, The Original is based on Hamish Robertson's 1963 Straight Malt recipe, considered by many to be the world's first single malt. Slightly sweet with notes of pear and vanilla.\n","616":"\nGlendronach Allardice 18yo (named after the distillery's founder) has been 100% matured in oloroso sherry casks. It has been at the centre of the distillery's range since its 2000's relaunch and remains one of the best sherry-focused 18-year-old whiskies on the market. Chewy and fruity, with layers of soft spice, and rich raisins and dates.\n","617":"\nA 20 year old entry in Tullibardine range, replacing their previous vintaged bottlings with classic honeyed dram, rich with malt and peppery spice.\n","618":"\nThe 2016 relaunch of Longmorn 16 Year Old. This is a full-bodied and complex whisky, with notes of sweet fruit, spice and heather.\n","619":"\nA fruit-forward dram from Benrinnes, best known for its rich, sherry-matured whiskies. This shows off the other side of the distillery, pairing up its weight spirit with a refill hogshead to create a \"creamy, opulent\" whisky, with a hint of smokiness.\n","620":"\nA sweet and softly smoky Highland Park from Gordon & MacPhail as part of the Connoisseurs Choice range. Distilled on 22 June 2006 and bottled at 12 years old from a single first-fill bourbon barrel on 18 September 2018. It's a whisky of two halves, with a fragrant and gently fruity nose leading into a darker and richer palate, run through with Highland Park's heathery smoke.\n","621":"\nA youthful heavily peated Port Charlotte, distilled at Bruichladdich distillery from Scottish barley and matured in first-fill ex-American whisky casks and second-fill French wine casks before a final year of marrying in French oak. It's all about the influence of the wood, and the casks have added sweet citrus and dark chocolate notes to the rich and peaty spirit.\n","622":"\nJura's Tastival bottling for 2016 combines three whiskies aged in different types of sherry cask \u2013 Palomino Fino, Amoroso and Apostoles. The youngest whisky in the blend is 14 years old and the result is a whisky with notes of vanilla, apple, white flowers, maple syrup and roasted hazelnut.\n","623":"\nA 1999-vintage whisky from an anonymous Orkney distillery, although we are fairly certain it's Highland park. Matured for 18 years, this has lost its rough edges, revealing the distillery's classic honey and peat smoke character.\n","624":"\nInchgower doesn't pop up often as a single malt, with almost all of it going into blended whiskies, but thanks to independent bottlers like Douglas Laing we occasionally get to try it on its own. This Old Particular bottling was distilled in October 1999 and matured in a sherry butt for 18 years before being bottled in February 2018. The sherry has done its work but this rich and fruity dram is still shot through with Inchgower's fresh and fruity style.\n","625":"\nBalvenie haven't often released fully sherry matured whisky and we're very pleased to welcome the 15yo Single Barrel Sherry Cask to the range. Each bottle is part of a batch of only a few hundred, each filled from a single cask. Every batch will vary a little, but all will show off the great combination of Balvenie's spirit and rich sherry oak.\n","626":"\nA litre bottle of Caol Ila 12yo, from arguably the most consistent distillery on Islay. Delicious, clean, medium-peated treat.\n","627":"\nA malt whisky of unmistakable honey-rich maturity and depth.

A mix of refill sherry casks and a generous slug of first-fill sherry-matured whisky.\nAwarded Malt of the Month - September 2014\n","629":"\nA 1996 vintage Ardmore from independent bottlers Gordon & Macphail, bottled in 2014. The distillery produces peated whisky, despite being in the relatively peat free region of the Highlands.\n","630":"\nRepresenting the Art of Whisky Bottling, as its beautiful label makes clear, this is a fruity, creamy Glentauchers bottled exclusively for Whisky Show 2017.\n","631":"\n","632":"\nA cask-strength edition of Glentauchers 20 Year Old, comprising just 154 bottles, created by independent bottler Claxton's. Buttery notes of sweet strawberry, cinnamon, dark sugar and vanilla, with a slightly spicy finish.\n","633":"\nAn Old Malt Cask bottling of Talisker from Hunter Laing. This feisty maritime dram was distilled in December 2008 and bottled in November 2018 after nine years of maturation in a sherry butt. The butt has rounded out the punchy spirit without adding too much of its own character, and the result is a classic Talisker, with sea-spray and black pepper surrounded by caramel sweetness.\n","634":"\nAdela is the 15-year-old offering from the revitalised Bladnoch distillery in the Lowlands. Matured in oloroso-sherry casks, this is rich and sweet with notes of dark chocolate, dried fruit, coffee and liquorice.\n","635":"\nA long-aged Ardmore, distilled in 1998 and bottled by Gordon & MacPhail as part of their Distillery Labels series.

Aged in port casks, this is sweet and fruity with a toffee aftertaste.\n","637":"\nThe 15th incarnation of Lagavulin 12 in the Diageo Special Releases, a testament to the sheer likeability and complexity of this whisky. Its relative youth compared to the phenomenally popular Lagavulin 16 can be misleading: this Islay whisky is rewardingly diverse, with smoke and fruit melded into minerality. Expect swirling layers of smoke, liquorice, charred meats and green tones of apple and sweet pear.\nThis cask-strength whisky has been created from refill American Oak hogsheads, each at least 12 years old.\n","638":"\nGlentauchers is a distillery rapidly rising in the ranks thanks to great indie bottles like this. Distilled on 23 July 1997, matured in a pair of bourbon barrels and bottled on 6 November 2017 at 20 years old. The whisky shows the distillery's fruitier side, so often hidden underneath layers of sherry spice.\n","639":"\nA rich, robust whisky with layers of vanilla, butterscotch, spice, raisins, heather, cherries and honey. This 18-year-old Speyside single malt is one of four whiskies released as part of GlenAllachie's new core range for 2018 \u2013 the first released since the distillery changed hands in 2017.\n","640":"\nA 1997-vintage Signatory Vintage release of single malt whisky from Glentauchers, distilled on 23 July 1997 and bottled at 20 years old on 7 March 2018.

Distilled in 2004 and bottled in 2018 from cask BL418. Andrea Ferrari knows how to choose a cask, and this whisky is a testament to that.

Top work, sir.\n","643":"\nOur second exclusive release in the shiny, revamped Connoisseurs Choice range from Gordon & MacPhail: a 2004-vintage, sherry-matured, single-cask Glenturret. It's spent its life in a refill sherry hogshead, but don't let the 'refill' part of that fool you \u2013 there's more than a bit of sherry influence here. Rich and spicy with stacks of juicy berries and raisins, it's the perfect winter dram.\n","644":"\nA long-aged dram from lesser-known Glenburgie, a big distillery with spirit that normally disappears into the Chivas Brothers blends. It's an important component and this release shows why: floral, fruity and complex, it's a pity we don't see more of it bottled as a single malt, especially after two decades of layering on complexity and flavour. Fortunately, Gordon & MacPhail have our backs.\n","645":"\nA 21yo has been added to Glencadam's rapidly-growing range. Attractively packaged and bottled at a good drinking strength of 46%, this is a distillery of great potential and definitely one to watch.\n","646":"\nThis 21-year-old Tomintoul boasts a floral, fruity, spicy character and was reintroduced in summer 2017.

This was distilled in April 1996 and bottled in August 2018 from a single cask at 22 years old. Ardmore is an unashamedly smoky dram, and this balances that against sweet caramel and citrus notes.\n","648":"\nThe Diageo Special Releases 2016 edition of unpeated Caol Ila, yet again shot through with a hint of smoke. It's a mixture of American- and European-oak-matured whisky, adding some richness to Caol Ila's nutty unpeated spirit.\n","649":"\nThis limited-edition release from Glencadam was aged in ex-bourbon casks, before being finished for the last few years in a trio of ex-port hogsheads. Sweet with notes of summer fruits, vanilla and toffee.\n","650":"\nA sherry-forward edition of the yearly Diageo Special Releases unpeated Caol Ila. While whisky from the distillery is usually very smoky, this yearly release looks at the distillery's other, less well-known side: unpeated spirit. The 2018 bottling was matured in refill and rejuvenated American-oak hogsheads and ex-bodega European oak butts, which give a balance of elegant vanilla and orchard fruit, and richer, sherry oak flavour.\n","651":"\nA single-cask bottling of Strathmill 1996, released by Hunter Laing as part of the First Editions range.

With five extra years, the whisky shows increased depth and intensity, showing off the titular American oak.\n","655":"\nA 19-year-old whisky from Teaninich, bottled at cask strength by Claxton's. It was distilled on 5 July 1999 and bottled in 2018 from a single bourbon hogshead at 19 years old. This is old-school Teaninich, back from before it's mash filter was installed and showcases the older nutty, creamy and sweet side of the distillery's character.\n","656":"\nA dark amber-gold, full sweet vanilla delicately smoked with a rich and long lasting finish. Glenfarclas 21yo is delicious stuff, and a bargain at this price.\n","657":"\nA 1980s release of Glenfiddich's no age statement Pure Malt single malt whisky.Please note: this bottle contains sediment.\n","658":"\nA tasty old 1990s bottling of 12yo Glenglassaugh with a pleasingly understated label, this easy-going medium-bodied Speysider is hugely drinkable, nutty and chocolatey with prominent tropical fruits.\n","659":"\nMacallan 15yo Fine Oak is matured in a combination of Bourbon & Sherry Oak Casks. This range has been around for a few years now and seems to have weathered the storm it caused amongst the faithful when it was initially released. This one is probably the pick of the (Fine Oak) bunch. \"Takes time to open but worth the wait. The complete package and arguably the best. 9\u00bc\/10\" Dave Broom, Whisky Magazine.\n","660":"\nAn old bottling of Old Fettercairn 10 year old. Founded in 1824, the name Old Fettercairn was in use up until then owners Whyte & Mackay were taken into new ownership themselves in 2001\/2. We estimate this bottle dates from the 1980s.\n","661":"\nA seasonal edition of Spey Chairman's Choice follows a tradition whereby the chairman of the company would select his best casks to serve to his family on Christmas Day. This is a special Merry Christmas bottling for 2014.\n","662":"\nAn exclusive 18-year-old cask of Balblair aged in a single refill bourbon barrel. This is a sweet and creamy whisky with notes of green apple, spiced oranges and roasted almond.\n","663":"\nTormore is one of the most beautiful Speyside distilleries, with hedges in the shape of stills outside. We have chosen this single refill bourbon barrel from 1996 \u2013 and what a whisky. Big, rich and spicy, this is packed with notes of chocolate, Christmas spices and fresh orange.\n","664":"\nA single malt for whisky sleuths. Glenlivet have created Code, a limited edition that follows Alpha and Cipher, to encourage people to experience whisky aromas and flavours without preconceptions. Pour yourself a dram and then, without tasting notes or cask information to guide you, enter Glenlivet's virtual challenge room (using the code on the back of the box) and see if you can crack this whisky's combination of aromas and flavours.\n","665":"\nAll but an orchard in a bottle, this special dram from Hunter Laing balances classic Glen Keith levity with a delightful depth of sweet fruit. Nutty freshness and a touch of tobacco on the nose give way to citrus & vanilla.

A fresh citrus aroma behind notes of mocha and toffee apple. On the palate dark sweet fruits with nuts and toffee.\n","668":"\nA sherry-bomb celebrating the 10th anniversary of The Whisky Exchange Whisky Show. We love Edradour's big sherried drams, and this one was a must-have as soon as we tried it \u2013 we bought the whole cask. It was distilled back in 2005 and matured for 12 years in a very active oloroso sherry butt before bottling in March 2018. The cask has layered on the fruit and spice, with intense sherry notes rolling out of the bottle as soon as you pull the cork. A friendly monster.\n","669":"\nOur first exclusive bottling in the revamped Connoisseurs Choice range is a stunning single-cask Glenlivet 2003. Aged for 15 years in a refill bourbon barrel and bottled on 7 September 2018, it's exactly what we want from Glenlivet \u2013 fruity and creamy with balanced spice. Another example of why everyone wants to look around the Gordon & MacPhail warehouses for casks \u2013 they have some great ones hiding on the racks.\n","670":"\n","671":"\nMatured in sherry casks, the majority of which were first-fill, this is a sweet and spicy whisky with notes of vanilla, fresh ginger and pear.This 18-year-old whisky is part of The Soleo Collection: a range of five whiskies from Glenrothes, ranging from 10 to 25 years old, which pay homage to the grapes from which some sherries, such as Pedro Xim\u00e9nez, are made.\n","672":"\nDelightfully full-bodied and subtly smoky Speyside with coffee and cocoa bitterness balanced against dark fruit and a rich earthiness and some oaky spice, owing to more than two decades maturing in a sherry butt.

Rich and surprisingly good value.\n","675":"\nThis is the relaunched version of Bunnahabhain 18yo, having ditched the caramel colouring and chill-filtration and upped the strength to 46.3%.

Tullibardine was founded on an old brewery site with a history that dates back to the 12th century.\n","831":"\nA 1995-vintage Linkwood bottled by Elixir Distillers for the Single Malts of Scotland range. Linkwood works well with a bit of age on it, and this single-cask bottling \u2013 distilled on 16 June 1991 and bottled on 23 June 2018 spent 27 years in a hogshead. The result is a elegant, floral and fruity dram.\n","832":"\nA rich, sherried Mortlach 25 Year Old with notes of cr\u00e8me brulee, orange marmalade, sultanas and dark chocolate.

This is a 10yo from the 1983 vintage.\n","846":"\nAn old discontinued bottling of Tamnavulin 10yo, we reckon this is probably from the late 1980s or early 1990s - at any rate, it was before the distillery dropped the 'Glenlivet' suffix.\n","847":"\nA 5 year old Tomatin, bottled in the 1980s, which was an interesting time for the distillery.

The whisky is more elegant than the other sherried entries in the range and is a contrast to its more concentrated sister cask (#2517).

A fitting dram to mark two decades of great independently-bottled whiskies.\n","945":"\nThe second release in Ardbeg's journey to the new 10yo, Still Young was released in 2006 and continued the successful 'path to peaty maturity' as the marketing types called it.

Lighter than you might expect for a sherry aged dram of this age, it's full of fruity and complexity.\n","2754":"\nOriginally produced for the American market, this is the oldest distillery bottling of Laphroaig, aged for 40 years and bottled at a cask strength 42.4%. Highly acclaimed by the whisky community, being awarded an average rating of 90 points by the Malt Maniacs.\n","2755":"\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2756":"\nAn incredibly rare bottling of Bowmore, this 1970 vintage was bottled to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Suntory's London office. The back label lists the seven general managers of the office up to the time of bottling in 2000, at 30 years of age. This was never sold to the public and is one of the scarcest ever Bowmores.\n","2757":"\nA brilliant richly-sherried send-off for a sadly now-defunct distillery. This is another malt that aficionados cherish despite it being relatively obscure, and it is thus extremely collectable.\n","2758":"\nOne of the stupendous cask strength Longrows bottled in the 1980s by legendary Italian bottler Samaroli. These extraordinary whiskies from Longrow's first vintage sealed the reputation of Springbank's peated malt.\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2759":"\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2760":"\nReleased as part of the distillery's Custodian Collection, this first release has been created from the oldest cask at Tullibardine. Distilled just three years after the distillery was built, this was finished in small sherry casks. Just 70 bottles have been created and it is presented in a gold and crystal Baccarat decanter in a beautiful wooden cabinet with a pair of glasses. A piece of history and a true collector's item.\n","2761":"\n","2762":"\n","2763":"\nArdbeg Double Barrel is something pretty special. This leather case from Purdey and Sons contains an Omas fountain pen, a leather-bound notebook for you to record your tasting notes and eight sterling silver cups. Oh, and two single cask Ardbegs from 1974 - both bottled at cask strength and packaged in hand-blown bottles with sterling silver labels. Just 250 of these sets are being released worldwide\n","2764":"\nWhite Bowmore has been gradually maturing in six bourbon casks\nin the distillery\u2019s famous No 1 vaults since 1964; they have now been bottled as a coveted collector\u2019s item for whisky connoisseurs throughout the world. An extraordinary melange of pure tropical fruit character with venerable oak and maritime notes.\n","2765":"\n44 years of quiet maturation in the famous number one vaults, has allowed an exceptional and rare example of Bowmore single malt to develop \u2013 the oldest one ever to be released from the distillery.\n","2766":"\nAn incredible whisky from Bowmore, this was distilled in 1957 and aged for 38 long years before being bottled in the mid 1990s. A legendary bottling which received 93 points from Serge over on whiskyfun.com.\n","2767":"\nBottled in 1991 in a limited edition of just 500 bottles, this whisky came from a batch of nine casks laid down in the 1930s (one cask was laid down for each of William Grant's nine children, who had helped to build Glenfiddich distillery in the 1880s). The whisky itself is one of the most amazing 50 year old whiskies ever to be released from any distillery and we actually like it more than the current version. It has an elegant, complex palate of subtle dried fruit flavours all beautifully balanced with wood spice, absolutely stunning !!\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2768":"\nThe third of the three extraordinary Oloroso cask 1964 Bowmores released in the mid-1990s, this final batch was of 1812 bottles. With an almost unfathomable concentration and intensity of flavour, and with the perfect balance of fruit, peat and power, this whisky deserves the frequently overused 'legendary' tag and has assumed almost mythic status amongst whisky collectors and aficionados. While the First Edition Black Bowmore is generally agreed to be slightly more magnificent than the 2nd or 3rd, it is really a case of 'first among equals'. Certainly the differences between Second and Third are differences only of emphasis and nuances of flavour, and are really only noticeable when they are tasted side by side (which few of us mere mortals will ever manage).\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2769":"\nA rare bottle of 1961 vintage Macallan. Just two sherry hogsheads were deemed good enough for this outstanding bottling \u2013 cask 1127 distilled on March 25 and 1581 filled on April 26, both left to mature for over 40 years before just 379 bottles were released at the start of the 20th century. A truly incredible bottling.\n","2770":"\nThe oldest Longmorn single malts ever released, and for a very special reason. On 2 February 1961, these two whiskies were filled into twin first-fill sherry hogsheads by George Urquhart, who led the second generation of the Gordon & MacPhail bottling dynasty, and sat side-by-side in the warehouse for 57 years \u2013 when they were discovered by Stuart and Richard Urquhart, fifth generation family members who also happen to be twins. The pair were fascinated by the prospect of whisky that mirrored their own experience \u2013 sharing the same DNA, but shaped by different maturation \u2013 and bottled both hogsheads, one European Oak, one American Oak, in tribute to the beguiling nature of twins. These two whiskies, each of which would be worthy of attention in its own right, together create a fascinating showcase of not only the maturation potential of excellent whisky, but also the captivating qualities produced by different wood on identical spirit.\n","2771":"\nA incredibly rare 60-year-old Mortlach from independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail. Just 100 bottles of this were released. Distilled in 1938, before World War II broke out, this is a piece of history. Presented in a crystal decanter in a copper, brass and wooden box with tray drawer containing a miniature of the same, this is simply stunning.\n\nPlease note that this is an old bottle and the closure may have deteriorated; care should be taken when opening the bottle. As such, the item is sold as described.\n\n","2772":"\nA real piece of Urquhart family history, this set combines the four releases from the Private Collection Ultra series \u2013 a decanter each of: 61-year-old, 1953-vintage Linkwood; 62-year-old, 1952-vintage Glenlivet; 63-year-old, 1951-vintage Mortlach; and 57-year-old, 1957-vintage Strathisla. An exceptional set of long-aged sherried whiskies. The set is without wooden boxes.\n","2773":"\nOn 14 January 1943, while the world sat under the cloud of war and world leaders, including Churchill and Roosevelt, met to discuss strategy in Casablanca, the Glenlivet distillers carefully filled sherry hogshead number 121. This cask had been hand-selected by the founders of Gordon & MacPhail, and was destined to be one of the last filled during the wartime period, as Glenlivet halted production in spring 1943. As the world slowly rebuilt itself the single malt aged peacefully, until it was bottled in June 2013 as a rare piece of whisky and wartime history.  This Glenlivet 70 Year Old from Gordon & MacPhail's Private Collection has complex notes including dark chocolate, orange, treacle, liquorice and subtle, ashy smokiness. Each in the series of just 40 gold-engraved decanters, is presented in a hand-crafted wooden box and comes with a commemorative book and certificate of authenticity.\n","2774":"\nVery similar in character to the Dalmore 50yrs in the crystal decanter (they are from the same batch of stock), this is an earlier presentation from the 1970s and is packaged in a smart black ceramic decanter. Dalmore ages better than perhaps any other Highland distillery, and gives Macallan a run for its money in the quality stakes, but stocks are always very low.\n","2775":"\nA custom-made cabinet in the form of a travel trunk, this extremely-limited collection contains fifty 200ml bottles, sampling every single Glenfarclas Family Cask vintage from 1954 until 2003.\n\nThis exceptional item also contains the following bespoke elements: 4 tumblers, 4 nosing glasses and a water jug, all crafted from the finest crystal by famed Scottish glass manufacturer Glencairn; 4 slate coasters; 3 hand-printed and bound leather books \u2013 one containing the history of the distillery, one containing George Grant's tasting notes for each vintage and a third destined to hold your own tasting notes \u2013 and a replica of the oldest known painting of the distillery, the original of which hangs in the Glenfarclas Private Dining Room.\n\nOnly 60 trunks are available worldwide.\n\nFor international orders, our customer service team will contact buyer upon purchase to organise shipping\n"},"name":{"0":"\nGlenrothes 2001\n\nBot.2014 Small Bottle\n","1":"\nGlenrothes Select

Creamy mouthfeel. Very comparable to Glenlivet 12, except Glenlivet 12 has a more floral aroma with a greater emphasis on the apples. Very smooth, little burn on this one.  Not too sweet, almost refreshing. Glenfiddich, especially the 12, is a pretty common scotch whisky, and for me, it was the first I ever had (back when I hated whisky!). It's an easy-going, approachable scotch for those not into the peaty savagery of Islay.

This whisky does not taste very natural and I am kicking myself for not buying the 10 year old!!\n","\nQuarter way through my first bottle of this and it isn't half bad. Yes, it is 40%, almost certainly chill-filtered and there is no age statement so you suspect it is fairly young, but it doesn't taste at all harsh. In fact the flavour is sweet, with a spiced honey and vanilla flavour that anyone who likes Speyside whiskies should appreciate. Don't expect the complexity of age statemented whiskies that cost a fair bit more, but equally if you can get this at the right price it is an awful lot better than the vast majority of blended scotches that it then competes with on price. The nose is initially disappointing with some rubber in there, but add a drop of water and leave for a few minutes in the glass to open up and this reduces greatly.

Finish: sweet fruit and toffee, surprisingly long diminuendo. It needs to sit in the glass for 20 minutes before drinking - afterwards any harsh alcohol (the source of the \"bitterness\" complained of) disappears.

Overall I would rate it as 2* or maybe 3* overall, compared with more expensive malts but in terms of vfm I give it 5* -  so I've given it 3* as a sort of compromise.","An unpleasant finish ,sour, not to my liking. I agree with David Lytham's comments. This malt just doesn't taste  very nice","Smooth and easy to drink sweet and oaky and reasonably priced enjoy as a nightcap with a single block of ice","Not complex at all, very bland.  It's a easy drink, particularly for a mixed crowd with a variety of scotch experience (good for a party - the price point is attractive for that use).  Not the whiskey that I'd enjoy after dinner.","Not again! no aroma, could taste the coconut, but compared to other single malts I've had, dead and wooden.","Make sure to taste first. I've drunk single malts for the past 40 years - love them all - and this is the first and only one I absolutely hate.","Very easy drinking, wonderful sweet nose","Really did not enjoy this one.  Only whiskey I've ever given one stars. A painful amount of woody sweetness overpowers it from start to finish","Woody satisfying taste pleasant enjoyable whisky","This is not a complex whisky and nor will it be for a lowland ?25-?30 bottle off the shelf supermarket buy.It is however easy to drink and not in the least offensive to the palate.Hints of cocunut,toffee and then backed up by the bourbon oak flavours this an easy midweek dram that I personally would stock alongside my older whisky's for an easy no brainer tasty and affordable cabinet filler.","To be honest reading the reviews, i was surprised.\nI found it completely different to that written.\nThin! Tasteless! And harsh way to much oak coming through.\nFor  ?20 fine but if you are willing to pay over ?30 for a bottle find something else.\nMe personally i will stick to talisker or balvenie","I love it...Solo smooth. I am an amateur where single malts are concerned.","This is the first time i have this whiskey .I found quite smooth and not as harsh as i thought it would be after being matured in bourbon casks for the price its a decent  dram .It wont be to everyones taste but for the price you cannot go far wrong buying this single malt .","I really enjoyed my first dram of this whisky (more drams to come!) but I had drunk a pint of nice bitter ale not long before. I found this a lovely contrast between the woody oak and toffee sweetness lingering on the front of the tongue. I'm not sure where the comments about 'thinness' are coming from. Possibly it tastes as if the alcohol strength isn't quite there,  but it's got loads of flavour, if not terribly complex. Within the oak I get hints of cinnamon and, yes I agree, orange. I'm mostly an Isla man but I could happily drink this after a cold day out. Well worth the money","Not a bad whisky .. Huge oak coming through.. lovely spice with some vanilla and cinnamon there also.. if it's around the ?20 mark then grab it up! If it's over ?30 then you'll find better","I can understand critisism of it's thinness but this is one of my favourite whiskys. I find the flavour comes theough very late on and is subtle and a very pleasant surprise.  If it were a wine or beer it would described as quaffable. Love it.","The main difference between Irish and Scotch whisky is that Irish whiskey is triple distilled while Scotch is distilled twice. This Scotch breaks that rule and triple distills it making it taste more like an Irish whiskey than a Scotch whisky, but still holding Scotch characteristics. It's good for what it is as well as the price. A good compromise between Scotch and Irish whiskey, but a representation of neither.","Remember this is tripple distilled and is a smooth whisky but it has plenty of flavour. It is one of my favorites","It's smooth, it has a fair bit of flavour, it's fairly inexpensive. However, it doesn't advertise any more than what you get. It is a pleasant lowland single malt. If you looking for something with a full body lots of nose and a kick. Not the single malt for you.","Very enjoyable","I drink single malt whisky all the time and I have tasted many. This is the only expression I have tasted from auchentoshan and I absolutely hated it. I have tried three times now and it just gets worse. No stars, but why won't it let me leave zero stars? One star because it forces me. Reminds me of Canadian mist. That is probably the barrels they aquired. I'm letting my girlfriend use it to make mixed drinks. I never leave reviews. This has compelled me.","I felt a very competent whisky with interesting flavors.  Definitely a step up from Glenlivet and Glenfiddich.","A very shallow and numb whisky even at the price point. Save your cash and look elsewhere.","Has a pleasantly citrus scent. Quite smooth, and just barely sweet. It has an aftertaste that reminds me a little bit of dark, bitter chocolate.  Pretty good, would buy again.","I tried this tonight based on the reviews here.  The taste is between a scotch and American whiskey, but it feels what can be described as a \"thin\" bodied flavor.  This would be a decent bottle at half the price.  It deserves two stars because it is smooth, but I the price is going to get it only one star.  I won't be buying this again.","I was surprised by the smoothness and the fruity flavor, and have this whisky on my 'next-buy' list.  After the first sip, I knew there was something different about this brew, and it was confirmed when I found out that it is triple distilled.  Thanks so much!","i bet it will improve...let that air get to it....but it's already right on....light but the oak\/bourbon synergy makes this almost petite-peat-y...! there's alot going on but it's like a big chunk of land in all directions....not so much (yet) with regards to the depths. it's already a mild-by-nature sorta dram so can't expect barrel proof depth, and that's fine! i hope i can manage to let this sit a bit and see if it opens to the depths of a short existence and shifts to 5 stars....recommended for the curious.","nice, very nice, very very nice.","I was a bit skeptical about a single malt being matured in bourbon casks however it has a  very surprising and pleasant initial taste, it''s fruity and sweet which i was not expecting, very smooth easy drinking.

Perhaps it is it's popularity and commonality that make this one so humdrum, because it's not abad scotch at all. However, there are just so many other similar scotches in this style that are far better. Glenfiddich boasts a real apples and vanilla nose that doesn't scare away but doesn't exactly blow one's mind either. For my money, I prefer the floral apple notes of Glenlivet for the same price, or if one is willing to dole out a bit more cash, the Glenmorangie Original runs circles around practically all lighter scotches in this sort of style.

The 18 year old is superb but there are better younger whiskys out there such as the 10 year old Glenlivet or 12 year old Old Pulteney.","The 12 year old is a fine tipple. Just because it is in every shop doesn't mean it is not a fine dram!","There is alot of coments saying that Glenfiddich 12 is bland, and in the past I would have agreed with them but I tried this recently and was blown away by not only how much it had improved but by how good it was in general, baked apple, pear, brown sugar, caramel, highland toffee and a touch of peat. nice to see it back to it's former glory a very nice dram.","One of my first single malts. Floral and estery on the nose. Not much complexity and could feel quite bland, but still very smooth and enjoyable. Very good for before meals and drinking on empty stomach.","One of the best malt whiskers I have tasted","A good, widely available, entry level malt and probably one of the first you are likely to taste. It doesn't take a genius to know there are more complex whiskies around, even the step up to the Glenfiddich 15yr is significant, but the 12yr is a pleasant and easy drinking starting point for anyone trading up from standard blends.","Decent Speysider for beginners; however, more advanced drinkers will easily recognize the lack of depth. 18 Year Old is the best in the series, without a doubt.","Consistent over years and years. Aable at a fraction above blends and grains, this has to be THE definative single malt for so many people. Yes there are better (My favourite is Lagavulin distillers, but it's 3 times the price of this) but for reliable, drinkable 'baseline' malt whisky there are a precious few who can be such valu and so reliable...","Much similar to the Glenlivet 12, Glenfiddich 12 is a terrific scotch to Single Malt Newcomers, and a decent scotch all round. very fruity aromas both diluted and undiluted as well as being relatively smooth on the mouth feel, Glenfiddich 12 is an excellent dram for its price and goes well any time of the year.","The fiddich 12 may be young, but it's a light and elegant malt, maybe not as challenging to the palate as an older scotch but every bit as enjoyable. People hating on its popularity aside, it's about a billion times better than your standard johnnie walker red (gag).","Having tried a few malts this year, Dalmore, Jura, Old Pulteney, Bowmore, and Glenfiddich-15 to name a handful, i'd rather avoided buying this one as it's such a common staple in most people's eyes. How wrong i was. What a lovely 12yr old Speyside, light and fruity. I even prefered it to the 15yr. Highly recommended.","great beginners whisky. Fresh and light. But when you go further, especially to smoky\/peaty or sherry monsters side, this one feels flat.","Not a bad malt,nice nose, some complex flavours going on but it does burn quite a bit on the chest some other singles in this price range do not burn my chest as much.","A great single malt. In my personal rating (I am not a Whiskey connoisseur) this is one is in the top section, but I would go with Dalmore if I have to choose between the two.","Tastes do vary, and some vary with expectation and price. To my taste the 12 has more 'zing' than the 18. There is a hint of talking down the 12 because it is common stuff. It is common because it is popular through good marketing, presentation, and (not the least) taste. At the price it is good value, although some of the non aged statement cask finished malts now challenge it and other similar whiskies.","glenfiddich will forever be in my heart as the one that turned me away from the god awful bourbon lols, first single malt i tried and loved it im sorry glenlivet may be better in your opinion but i will forever be loyal to glenfiddich have tried 15 and 18 love them all","Blond-weak body. Nose wet-wood","Fruity, easy and smooth. There is not much complexity. A nice, affordable malt for beginners.","the most consistent scotch you will ever  try","I suppose if you wanted to be mean you could say it is a bit bland but it is hard to deny that this is a delicious dram with a satisfying classiness and quality and a great lingering fruitiness.","i only like glinffich .i love it .very smooth.out standing taste.belive in better","The green Vanilla does It for me; Utter perfection.","I like it and think it is very good but I am not a whisky snob.","Had high expectations for this, but this one proved a bit disappointing. Recently bought Glenlivet. Hands down, I would go for Glenlivet anyday.","good malt for beginers but lacks a bit of depth for me, its almost like an irish whisky, 18 year old is much better","On a scale of 1-10 I would put the Glenfiddich about a 7.5. Lagavulin is my favorite and the only \"10\" I would give. But it is very expensive. The Glenlivet is what I buy for a more affordable and rate it about an 8.5.","I too am a Glenlivet man at heart but the Glenfiddich is an old familiar friend, always on hand when the alternatives are Bells and Bourbons.","glenfiddich is my favorit foerever!","Have to agree with Kim, for around the same price (usually cheaper) I'd go for The Glenlivet for a smoother, more interesting dram. This is okay for a weekday whisky, however much prefer the more complex drops (Highland Park, Old Pulteney) for slightly more outlay.","The first thing that stroke me when i opened the bottle was the destinct smell of pear. A lovely and smooth character. It suits the rookie who wants to get into whisky or the one who just wants to have a light and easy dram after dinner. Great value for money.","I was given a 1 litre bottle of 12YO from my father-in-law, and this really helped to appreciate family relations:)And seriously a well crafted dram, fresh and round.","A quality dram and no mistake. There's nothing to dislike about this one. Smooth with a lovely flavour and a good aftertaste. It's not spicy or peaty which leads some to say it's bland but I think it's a tasty drop of gear!","Good but no cigar ! I prefer full flavours so though the integration and balance is outstanding the taste doesn't develop quite enough. A great starter malt . the 18 year old is worth the extra cash !","Very drinkable and it's easy to detect the tastes described on the bottle, but I feel that takes a bit of the fun away. I think I prefer The Glenlivet.","the best scotch 12 year old i have drunk","cheap and fine enough to become anyones house single malt.or a grand intro to the world of smsw.","It is easy to see why Glenfiddich has taken over the world. A pillowy sweetness is easy to appreciate but there are also added dimensions to the mouthful. A very well-crafted malt.","A lovely whisky. I am a 20 year old student who recently bought a bottle of Glenlivet in the hope of getting into whisky. This is my second bottle, and I thoroughly enjoy it. The \"rose petal\" and \"pear\" taste described on the bottle is noticeable. A very enjoyable tipple."],"56":["\nMy go to 10 year old whisky.

I have read all the reviews and for the life of me don't understand where all the straight alcohol overpowering people are coming from. It is incredibly smooth and complex. I will be buying many more bottles in the future love it.\n","\nHere in the US it's 43%. And under $25 before tax. I first heard about it (and also Old Pulteney) from a certain Youtube personality\/institution who tends to wear a plaid jacket and a Scotch bonnet, who said that it is \"everything Glenlivet should be\". And I like Glenlivet 12, but only buy it on sale. When basic \"glens\" aren't on sale I'd rather spend more and try a premium malt.\nI won't get into tasting notes, but I've given this as gift to malt newbies and it's a great budget intro (it costs way more in other states). I tend to keep one in my cabinet for those occasions when I don't want to deplete other bottles. Sure, I love my Islays as well as Craigellachie, Aberlour, Highland Park, Macallan, and I like 46% and no chill filtration and no colorant, but I also like value. This and Old Pulteney 12 are well-kept secrets, I almost fear talking about it :)\nMy rating of 5 stars is based on value. It's not the most complex or unique malt, but it's full-bodied. Don't spend on it more than on Glenmorangie 10 or Old Pulteney 12.\n","\nLike one of the previous reviewers, I just could not get past the heavy alcohol taste that just obliterated anything subtle. This was actually an impulse buy that was on sale, now I think I know why. Cannot recommend this, spend a bit more and get something better.\n","\nVery smooth and goes down easy with a balanced light fruity flavor. Not a bold flavor that some seek but then again I like light beer and can't stand IPAs. Great for sipping with or without a cube of ice.\n","\nIt's my go-to for my scotch fix. It's smooth, clean, not hot. I like the highlands as an evening sipper. Glad it's so good, the price is equally nice. I have turned many scotch drinkers on to Speyburn 10.\n","\nThe straight alcohol taste overpowers all other tastes advertised. I struggled to get through this bottle. I may only be a scotch whiskey drink for a few years and may not have experienced all, but... try something else or spend $10 more and get some Glenlivet 12.\n","\nMuch better than the price would suggest.\n","\nAfter drinking this I can't believe the price easily could be an everyday after work drink.\n","\nI pretty much agree word for word with the anonymous reviewer prior to my review\nI wanted to buy this because in my specialist book this whisky was written up as sweet although its score wasn't so high and I am glad I got to taste this for free recently.\nI would have been very dissapointed if I had bought it\nPretty much a dissapointing whisky!\n","\nOk the good reviews convinced me to try to save 20 bucks and try this. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just not very good. I will agree that it has some pleasant notes, but there\u2019s just no body. It just tastes thinned. And it does lack the aroma as well. I think it\u2019s prices appropriately.\n","\nCan't judge this bottle by the nose up front. But it has a very balanced flavor between sweet and smoky. I agree with JJR, it seams to develop with a little sitting. A touch of warm caramel on the nose and good malty smoky finish. Their seems to be a flavor I can't identify but I like it. Can't beat the price and quality. I can't wait to smell the bottom of my glass when the last of the dram evaporates in the morning.\n","\nNice flavor. I just bought a bottle this evening. I'll be honest, I didn't like the nose right off the bat (thus 4, as opposed to 5 stars), however I'm a little biased regarding the nose of the less peaty drams, such as this one, so one may want to take that bias into account. I poured a dram and let it breathe for 10 minutes or so. I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. A very pleasant and interesting flavor indeed.

Lovely drink, step up from some Irish whiskey I've been trying.\n","\nI agree that it doesn't seem as good as the old HP 12, which, as Michael Jackson said, was truly the best all-rounder. It seems to have lost most of its peatiness. A delicious licorice aftertaste, with the pineapple edge noted elsewhere. Still interesting, not quite as awesome.\n","\nI have been sipping this fine malt (always neat in a glencairn glass) for a little over a year & let me tell you the 'old' bottling (which ive been through 3 bottles) tastes exactly the same as the 'Viking honor\"(currently halfway through one of the new bottles). Im from north america and for me its 43% abv. The nose: its very complex with it starting very sweet, lots of sherried fruits of honeyed pears\/red apple mixed with that classic highland park orkney peat so sweet & mild, friendly and inviting and also has a spicy character of cinnamon, a very pretty nose. The palate: very sweet sherry arival reminds me of a candy honey, very fruity, the smoke is definitely there but its not nearly as smokey as other island whiskys or islays, the cinnamon spice can be mistaken for alcohol burn or being \"rough\" on the throat, but it is a complex spice that finishes dry, so its typical to drink water alongside your dram. The finish is long, dry, sweet & smokey. My favorite scotch, the first whisky i really shined up to, it is for sure a journey to sip this dram because what you eat makes a big difference, i will also get a big salt flavor and sometimes caramel it will change every day and that makes it very interesting detecting different flavors while you enjoy a glass. Its sweet & smokey with very rich spices, this is the bottle that features all of what scotish whisky has to offer, the very best.\n","\nOpened my first bottle of the Viking Honor 12 yr after having been a regular consumer of the older bottled 12 yr.

It's so bland and light, with a super sharp alcohol finish. What a waste of money.. Stay away if you liked the previous version\n","\nOn the contrary, I think all but new whisky drinkers will be disappointed. This represents a continual decline in Highland Park. Also, I think Gavin Smith's review to the left is based on an older UP. Either way, this is cloying and boring, with very little of the delicate peat and Heather notes of old.

I think it's the worst possible option for the money and you're better off buying a Glenmorangie or even a simple Glen Grant 10.\nThe nose is nice, palate is average and lacks complexity and the aftertaste... well... I decided to have a snickers bar afterwards to get rid of it. It's like burnt wood together with old car tyres...\n","\nMany reviews here say the new 12 year old is not a patch on the old 12year old. My taste buds must be shot because in a blind tasting comparison I couldn't tell the difference between the two. Shop around and you will get it for ?25 which is excellent value for what it is.

I would give it 4.5 stars, 43% ABV, great nose and palate. A must try for sure, one or the best values out there.","I like sweet whisky but this is sickly sweet and smells of artificial apple. Not bad at all though as has strong and interesting taste .","Beautiful single malt I`ve ever had and will buy from now on","I\u2019ve only been a Scotch drinker for a few years now. I have tried several different single malts from each of the regions. This is currently my daily evening dram. Just the right amount of smoothness and smoke at a good price. Highly recommend for someone who wants a little more flavor out of their Scotch.","This is not bad at all. It's a 'classic' with a slight smokiness and round nose and palate, a bit short on the finish but it's 40%.","Everything about this scotch whisky is brilliant! The smells is very complex the taste has a nice kick to it enough to be enjoyable and the finish consists of smoky wood and smoky spice, brilliant!","What have they done? Compared to the standard 12yo, this tastes watered down, with hardly any body or nose.\n\nThe Vikings have lost any honour with this revamp, style over substance, and ruined one of my favourites.\n\nNext time I'm in Kirkwall I'll tell them so in person.","Have tried a limited amount of whiskey being a 25 year old. But for me this is amazing. \n\nOf the nose i could tell this would taste like something id enjoy, damp wooded smokiness invited me for a try.\n\nA very smooth non intrusive sweet and fruitiness taste almost a honey lemon without the bitterness.\n\nTo finish a taste of smokiness and wood that you can enjoy for a while before going in for another taste.\n\nI think the low ratings are from those with a good knowledge and experience of whiskey drinking. For an amature this is spot on and an actual joy to drink!","5 Star Whisky!","The last time I tried this was about 6 years ago, long before the beautiful packaging upgrade. There is More peat than I remember...reminds me of Bowmore 12?  But it does. The sherry influence is also evident. I think it\u2019s good, not amazing. A solid dram.","Felt in a bit of rut as I grabbed another bottle of Laphroiag.  Very disappointed, especially since I paid $10 more for this. It's not terrible, but I'd feel better if I bought a bottle of Teachers. I don't know what the old bottling of HP12 might have been, but I'll never try this again, not if I'm buying.","This is from  an English man.  I've tried several whiskeys but this by far the best I've tasted. Nectar of the gods!","Heartsick for the old version. I had both over Christmas - the old followed but the new. Sorry HP, I'm moving on.","It's fair to say that this is easy to drink. That's about all I can say. It's not complex, or challenging, or even that enjoyable.. it's totally middle of the road. Therefore: 2.5\/5.","I bought two bottles before Christmas. I looked up these reviews to see if I had bought duff bottles! Highland Park was a favourite of mine, but my first thought was that someone may have tampered with the first bottle.","I'm really saddened by this release - and sorry if this review is similar to others here, but it must be said.  The old HP 12yr was a beautiful and sophisticated arrangement of sweet and smoke.  This \"Viking Honor\" is NOT that.  The palette is similar to the old bottling, but the nose is immature, and the finish is just completely absent.  It's weird - I've never had a scotch that disappears like this one.  I'm pretty sure the description being used here (e.g. \"gold standard\") is for the old bottling.  Beware HP fans.","HP 12 used to be my fav value all rounder malt. Just got a bottle of the new 'Viking' 12 yo and it is nothing like the whisky I used to know.  It has a rough hard alcohol edge now despite being 40%, it has more smoke than old too (fashion or something else going on?), but that is mixed with a sulphur tinge indicating poor barrels in there somewhere. Was HP 12 a victim of its own deserved success? Have standards been dropped to keep pace with demand? If so they should have given it a break until they could have been sure that what was going into the bottles was worthy of the name. The bottle is very nice btw, but sadly not the content anymore. It is a similar alteration  for the worse that we had with Black Bottle blended, once one of the best blends, now meh, and meh is a suitable word for this misnamed 'Viking Honour'.","Really fresh, creamy, floral sweetness, citrus, honey, fresh lawn maybe, perhaps scorched fresh orange oil (like when garnishing a Cosmopolitan), agave syrup maybe, light smokiness with a lovely pepper and spice finish.. Very nice Island malt, opens up lovely with a few drops of water.","Probably one of the best Wiskey's you will ever taste","Quite simply the best dram at this price you can buy with the Balvenie Caribbean Cask a close second for pure drinkability.","This was my favorite the old 12 was far better then the Viking honor more honey longer after taste there is something missing in new Viking honor  hp please fix this dont get me rong this is still a good whisky bud it just lost a star bud i like the new package bud the old round botle was far nicer and far better whisky.","I tried the new Highland Park Twelve Year Old Viking Honor.   Although similar to the old 12, it has much more of a bite.  I was very disappointed in the new product.  The old 12 year was my favorite.  Does anyone else note this difference?","Great all rounder this but maybe to fruity for me. The green apple is very prevalent on both palet and nose. To me it's like apple boiled sweets.","Not sure what has happened to this. It seems to have lost all its delicate nuances.   Like a faded memory, there is still a hint of the old HP aroma; but there is barely a finish, and overall this is sweet and cloying. Very disappointed with this latest iteration. Style over substance, much like the packaging.","This is a superb all round dram. The nose is floral and sweet, with a hint of orange and the mearest ghosts of peat smoke lingering at the back. \n\nThe palate is complex. The initial sweetness had a fruity flavour I couldn't quite place at first. I got the typical fruitcake that comes with sherried whisky, but there was something more. Then it hit like a long lost memory from childhood - pineapple chunk sweets.\n\nThe finish is long and spicy. This is when those smoky ghosts come back to haunt you. \n\nTruly delicious.","This is without doubt a very top malt loved by many malt drinkers known to me","Sweet, little smoky and easy to drink. Kinda blunt palate for me doesn't have any distinctive character","Fairly new to the scotch scene but this scotch is fantastic. Sweetness with just enough smoke, a classic for sure. It's bottled at 43% ABV in Canada which is a bonus, a must have in any collection.","With its initial sweet note that transgress to a sour full hit on the tongue with a oak smoke finish what else could you want from a malt sweet note to the glass front leading to a fruit centre of fresh cooking  apple at the back of the glass comes the smoky wood","Big flavour, complexity, balanced smoke and sweetness. Fantastic value!","Choose another single malt.\nI can clearly rate this as one of the worst single malts I've tasted.","Not at all that tasty as the old one","This, in my opinion, is the best introductory peated dram out there. The bottling I have is at 43%, bought in the USA. The Isle of Orkney has a unique peat, and Highland Park doesn't bomb the dram with peat like most Islay offerings do. This is a fantastic crossover whisky, with a wonderful honey and floral sweetness melding beautifully with the Orkney peat and smoke.","Very satisfying - meaning there's no reason, it's not necessary to search for anything as it delivers without wanting more.","We were introduced to Highland Park when we took a tour of the distillery on Orkney in April.  We really enjoyed it and bright back a bottle to the states.  Understanding thre distilling process has heightened our appreciation for the taste as it stimulates the sencses.  Thrilled that we can still obtain it thru the Wisky Exchange.","A delicious dram with the complexity of much more expensive whiskies.  A silky smooth sweetness with just the right amount of smoke in the background.  Just dram delicious.","HP 12 is my \"go to\" whisky.  It is indeed a great \"all rounder\"; providing enough peat and resin to keep things interesting, but not enough to overpower the average palate.   If I had to drink one and only one inexpensive whisky for the rest of my life, this would be it.","Not as full-bodied as I had hoped after reading other reviews.  Obviously nowhere near the quality of Lagavulin or Talisker 16 , but HP 12 has a nice smoky finish and is smooth. And for that price, it is a steal.","Don't know if it's because I have a cold...A little agressive going down, short finish.  Tasty none the less.","Perfect whisky for my taste.","Smooth with fruity notes, well pairs with apples. For it's price it was a perfect choice for the evening company of 3 friends in sky resort.","Excactly what it said and more  mr","I've got this in 43% abv and WOW! What a nice sweet, fruity, spicy number this is and the little hit of sweet smoke at the end..... sends this babay over the top. EXCELLENT!","Perfect balance of smokiness and sweetness.  It has a delightful woody and slightly smoky finish.  A wonderful whisky.","My go to whisky, never had s bad bottle, pure balance... Best 12 I've tried!!","If you love peat bombs this is not for you. Subtle smoke, honey, malt and smooth finish. Nice for the price.","The product is AWESOME!  The tasting notes like \"salted lemons...crunchy green apples...\" are absurd and mendacious.  An attempt to seem, rather than be.  HP12 needs no idiotic advertisement.  Best for the money, by a long shot.","Drinking neat: lovely earthy peat, brine, charred oak, floral, tangerine, grapefruit, custard, sugar sweet, jasmine, citrus, bandaid. It is in fact a very well rounded dram. Like a mix between a Highland, Islay, & a Speyside; with each playing a equal role. The first thing that hits you it the peat smoke and brine, followed by the rich decadence of a Highland mix with a floral and fruity Speyside. I've heard about Highland Park since first taking an interest in Scotch and with it, high praise and recommendation. I'd say it's a very enjoyable whiskey that I will happily consume but would I put it on the same pedestal as my Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban, Lagavulin 16, or Laphroaig Triple Wood? Not likely. In fact, when I first took a sniff and sip of this from the bottle I grabbed my Laphroaig Triple Wood to compare the peat. I nosed and sipped the Laphroaig and immediately realized it was world's better than the Highland Park. I'll say though, HP is very balanced and gives the best of all three regions listed above. It's definitely worth a try.","Hmmm... I have to say I was slightly disappointed when trying this whisky.. Everybody told me it was the perfect combination of peat smoke and sweetness... For me though. It tasted surprisingly weak, maybe I had a bad batch? not as peated as I had imagined.. However lovely heather honey notes coming through under gently smoke. not a bad whisky by any means but didn't live up to all the hype.","20yrs ago I would have told you this was the finest all round single malt. These days it's a shadow of its former self. Still a whif of smoke and heather but the body has gone. The pressure on stocks means it no longer gets the same chance to test or mature.  Try a bottle from the 80's or 90's and you'll see what i mean. I would rather they raised the price and kept things as they were.","This is one of the best single malt","I have to be honest, this isn't what it used to be. It used to have a lovely heather\/ honey interplay with a whif of smoke and a medium body. I've just had a recent bottle and it was anaemic by comparison.  One of the greatest has become poor.","Subtle smoke infused honeyed whisky. Very hard to beat on price for quality. This is a special one. Hopefully it maintains its exceptional quality.","Good whisky very malty with slight smoke and sweetness on the nose. On the palate it feels think with a nice combination of peat and sherry sweetness mixed with heather honey smoothness. The finish is fairly long with a slightly salty aftertaste. This is a peated whisky but it's an Orcadian peated whisky. Orcadian peat contains a lot of decomposed heather which makes it lighter and sweeter than Islay peat which is mainly made up of decomposed maritime plants. Excellent and unique every one should at least try this if not add it to their collection. This review is from someone who likes all styles of single malt as long as I can find something unique about them.","It is nothing special.  I bought the 15 years old and did not meet my expectations.  I would rather stick with the Chivas Regal 18 years old for the same price","Thin body, watery mouthfeel, peaty, little to no sweetness, sour lemons, harsh.\nI won't buy this again, it was very disappointing..","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nFine sherry, Florida oranges, majestic Orcadian peat, subtle wood smoke, and a handful of stones.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nThe finest Oloroso sherry, orange rind, raspberries, wild honey, and a thin layer of pomegranate. Underneath all that is heather and subtle Montecristo smoke.  Great and a very unique floral complexity for a 12 year old single malt.\n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nDry, tingling pomegranate, Australian red licorice and the distinctive heather of this distillery that cannot be replicated by any other distillery.","Very nice!","Stock up for the future. 40% a little bit weak. Mass market production","I have good collection off single malt this one is my favorite litle bit off everything perfect ballans.","Not a bad scotch, though at first I didn't find it to be anything remotely special. In fact, I still don't. That said, it's decent. Some light smoke, lots of the \"heather\/honey\" flavours going on, though really just ends up tasting like a generic Speyside with a little smoke going on. It's fine as far as it goes, but nothing like what I thought\/hoped it would be.","I didn't enjoy this at first. However, now I get the honey and sweetness. It's a full taste, and I really enjoy it now.","Has a very light note of peat, very sweet, smooth to its core. However, disappointing and lacks distinction. .","Nose: Mass produced lager, baby sick (butyric acid), some tropical fruit and that''s about it.  The body is better at 40% than the watery travel retail warriors, but sadly the taste (which has a flaw that tastes a bit like soggy, mildewy leather) loses to the said warriors.","Awesome!","This is my favorite whisky. I would describe it as a smooth explosion of flavors in my mouth. Sweet, honey, spicy due to the sherry casks, slightly peaty with heather. It is beautifully balanced. Both the nose and palate have a beautiful hint of peat.","One of my favorites","I tried it last night for the first time.  I thought it was really silky smooth.  One of the best I''ve tasted, if not the best at it''s price point","I have tried many single malts and I keep returning youths as my daily dr choice. In my opinion you can not find a better whisky for this price. It has everything: smokiness, smooth delivery and beautiful honey notes. I have already emptied 3 bottles and will stock on more.","Being fairly new to malts, I had heard many good things about this scotch. Its name came up again and again and seemed to fit the ''profile'' of what I would like. Perhaps I hyped it up too much, but I was a little dissapointed. I finished the bottle a month or two ago, but from memory I found it a little smooth and dare I say middle ground. It seems this what the whisky is meant to be, and I''m sure its my lack of ability to really be able to pick apart the flavours, however I kept hoping for more umph, and found it a little creamy and malty for my tastes. I think I''ll revisit this dram when I have tried many more, I may feel differently as my experience grows :)","My favorite whisky in this price range","Purchased based on many good reviews. Gotta say it''s definately a delicate, smooth whisky with interesting crispness. However it doesn''t seem to have the big taste explosion i was expecting. As it''s a little too laid back, i''ll say it''s good, but not great. 6.8 out of 10.","After now buying and tasting over 25 popular single malt's I keep getting lured back to the bottle of HP12 in my cupboard. It seems to be a jack of all trades for me, my peat love and my sweet tooth. I have also sampled the 18 year old and it was amazing but i couldn't pay \u00a3100 for it.","Peat. Smooth, warm, so mellow. What a malt.","Smooth,sweet & subtle. However, the moment you add water or ice the nose and palate become very floral like a speyside. I much prefer it neat.","I agree with the general consensus , for the price, it's a special one for me\nEnjoyable smooth and slightly smoky. One of those whisky's you think about\nfrom time to time at work, you know what I'm on about!","At this price you would be hard pushed to find a better dram. It's got honey, heather and just a slight hint of peat smoke in there.  Have tasted better more complex whisky but at more than double this price!  Never disappoints","A very well made whisky. I like it very much, it is one of my favorites and I would not hesitate to recomend it to you.","HP 12 is not exactly what other reviewers here are trying to make it to be. Sherry-sweetness and honey are overwhelming and the alcohol doesn't seem to have integrated all that well. Lack of maturity shows itself in every sip. HP malts respond very well to aging, which is exactly why you will find worlds of differences between the 12 and 18 YO expressions. This expression is rather premature and it is far from being balanced between nose and palate. Not a gem.","A bottle of this is in my house at ALL times. I have yet to try the 18yr old but HP12 has accompanied me for few years now and is the one I always go back to. Sometimes I fancy a peaty, smokey stuff and at other times I'll go for Aberfeldy or Cardhu that go down smoothly. But Highland Park has never tasted \"wrong\" to me. No matter my mood or the weather. Always hits the spot. It's THAT good.","The best malt out there in the market. Very hard to beat or better.","HP12 good smokey flavour on your palate, a whisky that punches above its weight for the value","Terrific maltiness on the nose, some Speyside character as well with chocolate\/mocha whiff.  Taste wise, sweet BBQ in a glass! Great smoke infusion but not too strong. At \u00a325 a bottle wonderful value.","One of the best all rounders, it has a bit of everything going on. I personally find the peat very subtle, particularly compared to Talisker, my favourite Island whisky. If you enjoy the 12yr and can stretch the budget on your next purchase, the Highland Park 18yr is a terrific whisky to try.","nice one, though i have to admit that i don't particularly like the speyside-like sweetness of it. however, i love how subtle yet noticeable the peat is.","Hands down the best Single Malt Scotch for the money.","Im A novice whisky drinker. Started with Mcallen ,Oban ,Glenlevit  . Was looking for something cheaper! Highland Park 12yr Hit the spot! Cant wait to try the rest","I have just tried HP12 and, on first taste, I am not a fan. I usually enjoy peated whisky and was surprised at how peated this was. However, there is peat and there is peat, and this has the same style of \"peatiness\" as Bunnahabhain and Black Bottle. To me there is a mustiness to the nose and palate which I don't find attractive.","Quite simply, this whisky ticks every box. For me by far the best all-rounder there is.","I was struggling to get in to the smokey side of whisky. Half a bottle in and I get it. The lovely briney, honey taste of the HP12 with it's subtle smoke finish has got me converted","I have been drinking this whisky for many years and it is truly the best value single malt on the market, I have tried a number of different malts from various different locations and at 5 times the price but will always revert back to HP12. As far as smokey peat malts go highland park has the perfect balance, you just have to look at that rich amber colour to know you are onto a winner! Enjoy!","I have enjoyed many malts but this is my all-time favourite. A great whisky for newcomers and experienced tasters alike. It never disappoints. In a word - Brilliant!!","Excellent taste and not so smoke very smoot and easy to drink","This is a huge whisky: it's complex and yet balanced and the multi-layered nature of Highland Park is fully demonstrated here. You get honey, fruits, smoke, all at different times. Just great.","Back in the days of being a complete whisky novice, I was dissuaded by a pub landlord from buying bog standard Glenfiddich and asked to try HP12. I am forever in that man's debt. It always warms the heart and never disappoints.","Sam, stick with it, it'll come to you. When you fancy a change from the simple sweetness of some of your other choices you may well find yourself revisiting this. It's got a bit of something for everyone. Enjoy.","@Sam: What you're tasting is the smoky flavour from the peat used to dry the barley. All whiskies (with few exceptions) do that, but most of them are only lightly peated so the smoke is undetectable on the palate. Highland Park is by no means the smokiest out there - if you didn't like the flavour, you should steer clear of peat monsters like Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Lagavulin, as well as Talisker, Caol Ila and Bowmore.","An admirable poison, this one.  More than that; my single favorite serious drink.  You can spend more, much more of course, but you're unlikely to do better this side of a king's ransom.  Life is short.  Have a good friend over, feed him well (better still, have your wife feed him well) and then, catalyzed by HP-12, repair to the easy chairs and solve the world's problems.  IMHO, the best single malt value out there.","I have only just recently become a whisky drinker so my opinion probably does not count for much, however i did not particularaly enjoy this one. It definately smells and tastes of TCP. The whiskys i have bought recently have been Jura 10, Cardhu 12 and Glennfiddich rick oak, all of which i find very pleasing. The reviews for this Highland Park whisky are very positive and i wish to know what the taste i am tasting is?","While nothing near like its glorious bigger brother 18 this 12YO is the true value for money, as stated previously. Nose: resin, sauna wood, dried apricots, honey, smoked sausage; flowery, smooth and seductive. Taste: hot, nuts, ginger, apples and honey; really smooth, truly hot stuff.","I completely agree with Mr T. Surely one of ther best value malts.","I reckon one of the best value malts there is as I'm sure many agree - the taste and label together always remind me of shortbread biscuits@Steve - find it strange you say the smoke is ridiculous. I reckon it's pretty subtle (each to their own - though I like this so much I find myself stangely protective)","Surprised how it seems to Scapa ! sure, it's from Orkneys but it's really similar :)Delicate and sweet, soft odor and rich palate... Good to start in the whisky world cause of these points.","Wonderful whisky! Very complex and well rounded. Lovely honey\/heather sweetness with a light hint of peat and smoke. I do also believe that I found hints of fruit or apples in there as well! Anyway, a wonderful whiskey. Worth every penny!","Whilst still a newbie in single malts, having only tried, seven so far....This is it, This is the one.Definitely agree with Chris about nuts.interesting what Steve says, as for me this is about on a par with Talisker as my favourite Scotch.I also found it to have lots of different types of flavour going on at the same time which really confused my brain, but in a pleasant way.","Just opened by first bottle of highland park 12yo.  It's so malty and nutty.  Is this the result of floor malting?  If so it'll be my first, and I like it.  Adding water makes it a nut-fest.  Taste very sweet and spicy, with a little bit of smoke at the background.  The finish is very short though.  Empty glass smell like cream cracker.","I must be the only person who can't stand Highland Park. I'll confess that this was my first single malt. The smoke is ridiculous. Behind that smokescreen its like briny seawater with the most random, oddly combined nuances. Though I can enjoy Talisker and some of the Isla malts, to me this is one is a weirdo. At least I didn't let it go to waste :)","This is a fantastic Whisky. I started off on some sweeter Whiskies, and am now moving up to more fulll body\/smokiness whiskies, I told this was a good place to start moving up the ladder and I really appreciate the presence of the smoke, in amongst the sweetness and the malt. Will definitely be purchasing the 18yo on this evidence","very nice, but try a Laphroaig or Lagavulin if you like peat and smoke.","Love this whisky. Slightly sweet, well rounded and sets the taste buds dancing. This is a malt to enjoy on any occasion. I'll have a large one, thanks.","It's cold here at the moment in the LOWlands and it gives me good excuse to bring my soul to a HIGHER level... So today I bought a bottle of HIGHland Park 12 years old... Wow, what a quality Whisky! I can handle a 1000-year Ice age now!","Although this is my ex's favourite single malt, I do not find it bitter.","Truley awesome whisky, subtle honey notes balanced very well with a slight smokeyness, can't imagine anyone would be unhappy with a bottle of this.","This fairly new 12 yo expression has slightly changed from the previous one. Not quite as smokey and peaty but certainly a little sweeter and softer. Loses a bit of the Orkney character but rewards the drinker wirh a more rounded and more honeyed offering. Still a Giant of a malt!","it's simply the best. I like trying other whiskys, but when I want something special, I always buy a HP 12yrs. And then I realize, I was cheating it with those other malts and nothing else can live up to this great drink.","A whisky of the highest quality. Really enjoy the peaty smokiness of this one. Quite distinctive in comparison to others. One to savour.","enjoyable well balanced,slightly sweet with hint of smokiness,the depth is not deep again not shallow,just enough to keep you intrigued and the taste buds guessing,compliments to highland park.","This is the one that started me on my quest to enjoy scotch! I think I've mortgaged someones house with all the scotch I've purchused.Terry","Half Way through a bottle of this. Went to Orkney last year camping and this stuff kept me nice and warm through the night. Lovely malt and not to smokey, just right. Great stuff.","Everything you could want from a great whisky.

Not sure what market they are trying to attract by producing this. I also think it is misleading to call it \u201cSelect\u201d as that implies some superior qualities, yet I have to report that I found none. Stick to the 10-year old.\n","\nJesus, this is incredible stuff!\n","\nSelect tastes like a superfund peat bog site burned by a wildfire, still warm, but now starting to be rained on.

Added to the fact the company is very reluctant to give answers, it is the worst whisky I have ever tasted.

Expected something similar to Lagavulin 16, the only other Islay I've tried and I was quite desappointed. It tastes quite watered down to me.

Is this normal ?","It\u2019s middle of the road Laphroaig to my taste.  It\u2019s smooth with some nice mild sweetness and oak.  Good, not great.","A much softer and subtler alternative to the classic 10y\/o \n\nDelicate smoke, no burn, a gentle peatiness with a lingering sweetness","Well balanced, sweet, hints of smoke..not your classic Laphroaig, but a well balanced expression! Great value for the $$","Interesting and subtle taste. Smooth as Laphroaig is known to be","I thought the select is a very nice addition to the 10, I don't like to judge a whiskey by the number on the bottle, rather my taste and if it has a complete profile of all the good characters I like. The \"select\" is my kind of Islay, as simple as that!","Being a Laphroaig all the hallmarks are there. Medicinal and smoky\/peaty but a lot more subtle and gentle.  I personally prefer the bigger punch of the 10 year old but I still find this a very drinkable malt.","Had my first try of this today. Was a very smooth whisky, but quite an acquired taste. Not sure it could become a dldaily dram though","Whilst I've had my fair share of Islays, the Lagavulin 16 being a favourite; I've never been a big Laphroaig fan; it being the polar opposite of my gravitation to sherried Speysides. So when I was bought this as a gift, I was simultaneously pleased and disappointed. How wrong I was! I can get why staunch Laphroaigans(?) could have reason to bemoan it's Lite approach, but I think it's a wonderful expression of the Laphroaig character and I'm grateful for this doorway back.","Initially medicinal (menthol maybe, or eucalyptus) on the nose, this gives way to sea spray and smoke on a rainy day.\n\nSmooth, almost syrupy in the mouth, not harsh.  Sweet, I think of moss and pine trees. Peaty, naturally.\n\nNot a long finish, initially spicy but mellows into a sweet and woody aftertaste. \n\nI would say it is an agreeable introduction to Islay malt for newbies but it won't have the following that the 10 or the Uigedhal does. Don't be tempted to compare it to the 10 - it's not and never will be, but it's pleasant as a midweek dram.","tasted it recently after tasting  ten year old; disappointed had a sharp burning  spirit taste lacked the depth smoothness of the former. wont buy again","It's just a light 10 year old and I like it. I love the 10 year old and this bottle is a light version of it. Perfect dram for the day before switching to the original for a campfire by the ocean at night.","As a smoke lover, Select isn't the punchiest, peatiest or most peppery, but the light sweetness and green mossy edge make it a really enjoyable drink for the 'not a special occasion but a bit of a treat' weekend snifter.","Soft to the smell. Rich full flavor but not overpowering to the first timer. Easy on the swallow. Taste stays with you to enjoy the richness for a few minutes. Very enjoyable.","Its my first bottle from this distillery, and I like it.  It's not a bad price point either. I'm still a noob by all standards, but this is not as bad as some say it is.","OK so after reading a lot of reviews (some good some bad) I thought I'd buy a bottle and try it out and I've gotta be honest .... it's NOT what I was expecting.. I thought it would be a mixture of peat and fruit and have some good qualities... But it honesty just tastes like Laphroaig 10 diluted with water! Thin and flavourless.. If your a PEAT LOVER then AVOID THIS and stick to then ten year old or the quarter cask (which is great) but don't waste your money on this. Trust me","Sherried Laphroaig? Why not? \n\nFor Laphroaig snobs - sorry, I mean purists - this expression will surely cause their panties to bunch up. Although I readily admit to being a Laphroaig snob, there's something about this dram that draws me in. The smoky, peaty notes are there, but they are married with a sweetness, some citrus, and a touch of fruit and mint, all of which harmonizes to make this an interesting and engaging experience. \n\nIt's by not means your typical Laphroaig, but I think that's the point. It's not supposed to be. I could see this being a great dram to introduce someone to Islay malts.\n\nTo be fair, I wasn't impressed with this expression when I first tried it. But when I stopped comparing it to the age statement expressions and just enjoyed it for what it way, I started to \"get it\".","Did anyone think this was a Laphroaig 10? Because it says \"Select\" right on the bottle. Evaluate a whisky for what it IS, not what it isn't. This is a very pleasant dram, smokey and peaty balanced out with lovely sweetness. Great mouthfeel and finish.","Nice enough whisky but lacking something. I don't know why you would buy this when you can get a bottle of the standard 10 for around the same price. Won't be buying again but will be finishing the bottle! :)","I wrote a previous review, which was fairly negative about the Select. After drinking more of the bottle, I think I was being harsh. The Select does not compare to the 10yo in its intensity, but it is delicate, sweet and has subtle layers of taste. Enjoy it for its individual character, I suppose and don't expect a version of the 10yo. I should have realized this before, but.......","Laphroaig is with out doubt my favourite whisky- actually joint first with Lagavulin 16- and I can't help but be disappointed with this. I bought when I'd forgotten the reviews, but agree this is Laphroaig Lite. It tastes like somebody half filled the bottle, then topped up with water. I love Laphroaig's big taste and peat reek, so this is not desirable. However, if the 10 YO is a bit too heavy for you, this may be a good option.","Well this took me by surprise! Sitting here after a gig evaluating the four single malts I Was given for my birthday,  today. Look, let me be clear. I like The heavy hitters me! I had most of The 10 YO CS Laps that were Released. I had two bottles of The wonderful 2015 Cairdeas. I had a great single cask from Berry's and TWE's own signatory aged sherried version","Lovely easy drinking whisky. A perfect starting point to Islay and laphroaig. A sweet taste coming through from the sherry cask and the usual smoky  nose for an islay yet it's toned down some. A good quality drink for your money.","Agree with many who are saying this Laphroaig is too sweet, won't be buying again, but will certainly drink the remainder of the bottle!","Nah, no. No finish... I'll stick to the 10y old. Hope they didnt come up with  this one to discontunue the 10y.  The 10y old is like an old friend that you keep coming back to , this is just a passer by. Not bad, not lasting either.","Rip off. Pale imitation of the real thing.","Agree with some previous reviews: perfect summer whisky from Islay. It has all the tantalising elements of the heavier drams, but quietly alluring and very pleasing indeed.","I really love this whisky. It is slightly subtle compared to other Laphroaigs, but very rewarding. It even carries some elements of the 18yo, which is one of my all time best whiskies ever. A higher ABV would have put it in a totally different class, but this is a great Isaly whiskt to start things off, before moving to hard hitters.","This whisky is from Islay, so it's good...this whisky is from Laphroaig, so it's good!...but. BUT.\nWhat's going on here?  I have long been a fan of Laphroaig, and I can't think of any reason why I would want to drink this over the 10yo.  This nose of this dram screams \"wild camping on the west coast\" - peaty boots and mussels on the fire, palate offers some soft grassy, herbal openings and a hint of seaweed.  But, where is the finish? - this malt tastes rather American and I dare say would be pretty good on ice (there is a fair whack of vanilla here), I know better than do this with Laphroaig: stick to what you know!","Bought this instead of 10 year old out of curiosity,  not bad in any way but a pale comparison to the 10 year old. feels like an introduction and the 10 year olds the main event.\n\nIts not bad but I spoiled myself by knowing what the 10 year old holds","Gently Peaty, peppery, creamy, bit of smoke.... Really very enjoyable blended whisky - if there was ever a case for blending I'd suggest this was it - not muddy in any real sense - in fact, a nice finely chiselled character of its own.","It's like a thinner version of the standard 10 yo. Disappointing. I will not SELECT again but I will finish the bottle!","Disappointing and won't be buying again. It's like the illegitimate child of a good Islay lass and some American she has met on holiday.....in Benidorm!!! Where is that classic umphh we look for in every Laphroaig, and too much vanilla! I, for one, am gagging for a bottle of the QC!","I like it. Its sweet and fruity almost like a sweet cofing candy, then The classic peat comes throgh and in The end oak oils linger almost like rancio...","I think this is a bang for bucks, nice summer dram.","I think this is a great masterpiece of whisky. I dont like the choire that owls that all Laphroaige should tastes the same.. Select is balanced, smooth and sweet but still has that punchy peat dna right in there in the finish. Spice, oils, peat, fruit, sweetnesss. Not the longest finish but the oak oils linger on for a long time.","It's like what they would have produced whilst on their way to perfecting a laphroig 10 yo.  I'll finish the bottle for sure but won't be buying again.","Got this as a present and was instantly curious. I love the Islays - the more peat and smoke the better.\n\nThis is not as hardcore as the typical Laphroaig, Kilchoman, Ardbeg and so forth. But good and pleasant. However,\nMy next Laphroaig will be the quarter cask. Just a preference thing i guess.","Top quality despite its age","I think its wonderful - enjoy","Great scotch. Tastes like a campfire in your mouth (Minus all the dicks).","It's okay (never found a bad one yet), but am a little disappointed considering the price.  I don't know what Select means, but it makes me wonder if they are trying to hide something as it just seems a bit lacking.  I will enjoy the bottle, won't I won't be buying it again.","Don't be snobbish people, it's lovely! Yes - toned down\/refined, but classy. Like Laphroaig mixed with, um, bit of talisker, bit of something floral.","Not as good as the standard 10yo, but still drinkable","I have to agree with MikeB. Drinking for the first time and dissapointed.","I''ve been drinking Laphroaig for 40 years, and wish I''d read the reviews before I bought this. ''Toned down'' is an understatement. I''ve had better blends. Very disappointed indeed. It''s  Laphroaig Jim, but not as we know it''.","Great drink, reminds me of the seaside","I was expecting to be disappointed given the reviews but this is an impressive Laphroaig, more polished than usual but still plenty of smoke and tarry rope. Excellent.","Laphroaig select is one of the great peaty whiskies. I have tasted the 10 year old and this has far more flavour. The different flavours are amazing. Truly a great malt","I''m  fully engulfed  in the subtle  pete, The flora is well balanced,  I''m not looking for a wound cleanser,  this is more than this was intended to be.  ..Scotch Drinker","A slightly smoother version of the original. Gives all the classic laphroaig flavour but a little more mellow. I''m hooked!","Pleasantly surprising. I am not a fan of the Laphroaig 10. Too much like tcp\/iodine. This bottle is much nicer and it is a very smooth, easy to drink whisky. It''s reminds me of an ardbeg 10 with comfy slippers on.  It has a wonderfully strong nose but is much gentler on the palate with medium peat strength and beautifully balanced. It is well worth a try especially if you like Ardbeg \/ is lay malts.","This is one of the worst whiskies I''ve had in a long while. I absolutely love Laphroaig, but I''ve no idea what they were trying to do with this release. It''s just... awful.","Select feels like a ''pleasant'' whisky, bit more gentle, bit more ''toned-down'', little bit more accessible (taste-wise) for those new to whisky who are in the process of developing their taste perhaps.  The taste is nice and it''s perfectly pleasant & drinkable, but that''s about it.. \nIn this price range I much prefer the classic 10yr old Laphroaig, which is a stonking whisky and cracking value for money.","this whiskey got smashed over at ''the other blog''.  glad to see its gone over a bit better here.  but really, disliking something because its not something else - why the dichotomy?   its whiskey - made by laphroaig - the same people who made the 10 you so reverently adore.  bigger, badder, meaner doesn''t mean better.  and if you think it does than stay away from wine! really, it''s all about expectation and laphroaig does carry expectation - now its expanded.  while its certainly lighter and without the aggressive medicinal personality of the 10 its really laphraiog''s more delicate side - the mint, citrus, and honey get a nod here via the sherry butts which is a nice change up from the sea spray iodine smoke char of the others.  sure if you were to try them side by side this would look ''puny'' but thats not what its about.   i think some people just want smacked in the face with a smoldering stick tbh.   for me, this is a nice bottle and i''m thankful for the opportunity to try something else from these guys.  3.5","This is a nice whisky! however it is not in the same class as the ten year old I feel it is an inferior product for this distillery I have been given two bottles by people who bought it thinking ok it''s Laphroaig thats what he drinks   I will enjoy but a bit dissapointed.","Dissapointing, far to young in my opinion. Stick with the 10 year old.","Murf, you are right. The colour is natural.  I''m surprised, because all regular range Laphroaigs seem to be caramel coloured. I hope they will get rid of caramel for good. However, I still think that overall quality of Laphroaig distillery bottlings are heading down because of high demand and higher production volume. I prefer indy bottlings.","I think some people (Mikko) are a bit confused here. The bottling  and Laphroaig website clearly state that this is ''no caramel'' natural colour. I found it much lighter than a 10 but non the worse for it, the very clean smokey nose was also welcome. perhaps a bit thinner and more spirity than the standard 10 but nice. Like the 10 takes a little water very well, seems to open out the palate and lengthen the finish","I can see why there have been quite a few naysayers - this is without doubt a mutant hybrid of a whisky. But I actually think it's pretty good. Maybe it lacks body, but it does fairly much what it sets out to do; that is, combining that peaty medicinal house aroma and initial smokiness with a sweeter, sherry aftertaste. Not for everyone, certainly, but definitely not a dud either.","What is going on? First QA then this. 40%, caramel colored, chill-filtered. That is totally wrong direction. Obviously they are increasing production volume and than can only mean lower quality. No thanks Laphroaig, this is a big mistake.","Very good whisky. I opened this with some trepidation after all the bad reviews but was very pleased with the nose and lighter smokey aftertaste. This one is going very quickly will need another soon.","Lovely stuff, the multiple barrel types give it a lot of complexity. If you love Laphroaig, this will strike you as a different beast altogether so try it with an open mind.","Laphroaig Light - it should be called. Something in this Froid died , but the vanilla-fresh nose is appealling - very sad. Not sure 35UKP (70$US\/CAD) is worth it, i would prefer Quarter Cask anyday."],"60":["\nAbsolutely fantastic whisky. One my go to favourites. Smokiness on the nose, followed by brine, peat and smoke.

I have to say that I don't think any of the great distilleries on Islay would own up to this! It is very underpowered, completely unbalanced and has more than a taint of the dreaded sulphur from a poor sherry cask. Not what a fancy label portrays or the picture depicts this is NOT representative of the superb Islay malts. \nR. Swinhoe","This is a simply wonderful big Islay dram. Very full flavoured and sweet with a denseness that gives it a liqueur-like quality. Very rounded for its age. Has the richness and fullness you expect from a south shore Islay.

Really quite awful stuff.

This is only just worth the \u00a320 I paid for a bottle, and I keep it around for the sake of having a whisky in the house I don't mind whisky-and-coke fans using. I may be being unfair to it here, as a lot of people seem to like it, but I think there are much nicer single malts for the price","Agree with Kelly that it is a pleasant, sherrish malt, with a very nice bouquet but lacking some character, notably finish is a bit too short and not leaving any aftertaste. Should be 46%. Still a good one for beginners or for every day budget-malt sipping.","I found this one pleasent, but rather forgettable. Not remarkable or outstanding in any particular way that I could discern, but certainly decent enough. Anyway, it is quite possible I missed some of the subtleties others have praised, so I would be glad enough of a chance to investigate it again.","This is a great all rounder at a great price. Try it there is nothing not to like about it.","I have 1 bottle in memory of my Father every Christmas, miss him having a few dram's with me","One of the first single malts I purchased and a good introduction to Speyside. Easy drinking style that will not offend anyone and good value for money. If you like this I would recommend trying Singleton, Monkey Shoulder or perhaps a Glenlivet 15yr old, all of which are readily available and easy to cheekily request for your birthday or xmas!","A straightforward malt but with a tremendously rounded flavour. An everyday, undemanding but ultimately enjoyable dram that you keep coming back too. Good value.","A great dram, & great value for money. I would recommend to anyone.","A memorable single malt whiskey.  Absolutely NO smoky taste whatsoever, simply a quiet, mellow and extremely smooth and sweet flavour. I have since put my Glenfidiche away and have made this my scotch of choice - just marvelous!","Pound for pound, one of the best!","Well, what can I say about this beauty that hasn't already been said.\r\n\r\nIt is easily the best 10yo malt around. \r\n\r\nPunches well above it's weight against the Glenfiddichs, Glenmorangies and the other big brands of this world.","My first taste of Malt Whisky , just recently. This is easy and smooth to drink. Leaves a fantastic warm feeling at the end. Difficult to put the bottle away","I would class this as a grower. It seemed a bit simple and sweet at first but after a while I really started to enjoy it and would be happy to recomend it to anyone wanting a smooth easy drinking dram.","Just a really nice uncomplicated and easy-drinking malt - you can even have it with ice in the summer!  I like the peaty\/Islay stuff too, but no reason to be be dismissive of this great value 10 yo.  The only real problem is that it's dangerously quaffable!","A pure, simple but brilliant reflection of Speyside Single Malt. If you want to transform this drink into something totally different - take a few drams from the bottle and top it up with Drambui and refrigerate it. NECTAR! A pleasant alternative to dessert wine, and it goes down a hit with the ladies at parties and also for dinner guests who don't normally drink whisky. SLANJE!","I prefer Irish normally but have started to dabble in some Scotch tasting. This is a very nice whiskey. Sweet and smooth. You could do a lot worse. What a delight!","A very tempting nose, one of the best in single malts. Even better honeyed, sherried, bourbon-vanilla palate. Excellent stuff! Although, the finish is rather short and the whole malt would probably be even better at 43 %.","The Beatles of whiskey: anyone can enjoy it, it is accessible but, if you want it to be, it has it's own complex network of flavours. This is the antithesis to smoky, peaty, salty malts like Jura or - gulp - Talisker. But then I am only 28, and not accustomed to fishing off the Hebrides on a cold winters day. A warm, honeyed hug in a bottle. The soft name rolls off the tongue. The sweet malt inside rolls down the tongue.","For years I always said I didn't like whisky, that changed about 15 years ago when I was lucky enough to visit the Aberlour distillery. At the end of the very interesting tour you're given a small shot and the tour guide explained that while there were jugs of water on the table you should try it neat. I can drink some other whiskies now but aberlour remains my firm favourite.","Whatever may be said about it, it still knocks the socks off the Glenfiddich and the Macallan.","Classic Speyside and good value... a very nice rich biscuity sherry taste though a pretty short finish","Sorry I just get nothing from this.","One of the best Scotch whiskey 10 years. Smell a pleasant aroma of malt and biscuit. In the mouth delicate and well structured a very pleasant mild pungency and a slightly bitter finish. A truly remarkable persistence of taste. Try to drink along with some biscuits or a dark chocolate pudding, I think is a true delight.","Amazing stuff for the price! I have two ranges of scotch at home: collectible and drinkable. While this one is clearly in the 'drinkable' section, for the same price as a Glenfiddich 12 or Glenlivet 12, it's miles ahead. Give it a shot!","Agree with most of the comments here. It is quite innocent initially, and sweet - a little light for my liking. the finish gets interesting though - warming with a hint of sherry spice. A fine entry level single malt, but if you want something more substantial and robust you should travel to Islay or Skye.","Great Malt Whiskey. A bargain at just over ?20.","I would like to agree with Ed Wigget...I find this a good scotch and it is growing on me, BUT I am always surprised at the lack of initial punch a drop of this gives, but I do like it's finish though.maybe it's just me but it does seem to benefit from being left in the glass for a short while...","Taken with a piece of milk chocolate, this malt will knock your socks off!","Bad one in my opinion. Choose instead Mortlach or Dailuaine - way better.","Lovely whisky, not at all smokey though, a typical sweet speyside. Great value for money.","One of the most underrated single malts in history. It very nice.","I think this whisky is a little overrated...i find it lacks the intial punch a good whisky should have of flavour before it softly warms the inside of you...to me it tastes like orange peel...but the warming sensation is quite nice.","For my first journey of discovery in the world of single malts, I found the Aberlour 10 year old to be an exceptionally smooth drink which I thoroughly enjoyed. I also stocked up on a bottle of blended stuff just in case I did not like my new acquisition but I should not have worried. I now cannot wait to try the 16 year old as recommended by D Scott.","A real smoothy! Orange peel","I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience of this recommended malt.It is subtle,smooth slightly sweet with a persuasive push to try more.Do not be drawn in by this mystical dram,for it will surely disappear in no time,delightful journey while it lasted [the   night]?.","Aberlour 10yr old is lovely but if you want something a wee bit more special buy the 16yr old. You will love it, just ask Dennis from the Aberlour shop. No smoke in this whisky at all. (tut tut).","sweet, simple and inoffensive. Some consider it to be a bit TOO smooth but for when you feel like a nice mellow afternoon drink its fantastic. Tastes better with a drop of water.","Sweet with a nice balance of sherry and bourbon notes and a long finish. Great value and a classic Speysider. Undervalued by some - not me.","I don't wish to be rude but the poster from15 Jan 2008 is incorrect in stating that this is \"smoky\" scotch.  Aberlour 10 is considered a bit on the sweet side as are many of the Speyside scotches.  If you want a scotch with the distinct flovor of smoke, I would recommend the Islay scotches e.g. Laphroaig or Lagavulin, or the scotch from the Isle of Skye -- Talisker.  But Aberlour 10 is a fine single-malt ... just not smoky.","A truly great whisky and so easy to drink , i put my bro inlaw onto it and he has been converted to single malt.If you want to warm the cockles on a cold winters night then have a go at this great scotch,it is sweet like honey with no shudder factor and a nice after taste , great with a Maduro cigar.","Have you tried Balvenie 10?","This is the first single malt i truly tasted. I foolishly drank a miniature of chivas regal with milk (i know, shame on me), and a friend gave me a bottle of this. I am now in love with its rich smoky taste, and i'm now on the hunt for one that can top it, which i am failing at. If you like a smokey whiskey this ones a bit of alright!"],"65":["\nNot a bad dram for the money.

It\u2019s a smooth, sweet whisky with a nice finish; slightly salty, a bit like Tobomory and other coastal Scotch.

I've started trying different brands and have had some decent (to me) scotch. This OP 12yr was on sale for 39.00 and so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. It fits my budget quite nicely. Very good in my amateur opinion. I would buy it again... and again.\n","\nExcellent! The bite of scotch with a slight honey and spice, but not overpowering.

Among the flagship 10-12 year old malts - those ubiquitous and not too expensive ones at every bar - this and Glenmorangie 10 have the most character to me. OP12 tastes older than its age and has nice complexity. FWIW I initially hated it - tried it in the same session after Highland Park 12 - a no-no! Since then I've bought a few more bottles, given it as gift (which was very much enjoyed).\nI am not into \"bottle A is better than bottle B\" - I do like some better, but I keep most of them in my cabinet and pick one depending on the mood.

On the palate citrus, slightly salty with a spice oak finish, very nice 12 year old that is widely available, recommend.","I usually agree with the whisky exchange tasting notes breakdown  but for me I get a salted caramel-vanilla cream well rounded sweetness with an after-bite of  mellow oak which adds some bitterness which is welcomed by that point. It reminded me of some high-end bourbons I had while in Manhattan last April.  Jefferson's Ocean aged bourbon and Blanton's come to mind, only better, with its own unique stamp of lingering spice I cant put my finger on. I just don't get much of any smoke, not that I was looking for it, but given the flavour breakdown from the Exchange, I was hoping for it to be there for me. Nonetheless,  well worth my money and the value for this malt makes me very happy. A bargain quality single malt.","I am one of the smaller number of people with reviews who doesn't quite agree with all the positive feedback here.\nI wouldn't say this is far from the one worst whisky's I have tasted but I found the scent very salty and so was the taste.\nit certainly isn't hard to drink and the color is good.\nbut overall for me it is a bit to Salty.","Well a special gift my wife bought me this whisky. Well what a pleasant surprise. It has the slight bitter bite of a 12 year old with slight sherry flavours. To the smell add deciduous fruit and citrus with a slight aftertaste of the air off Skye. Delightful.","Love it,  want sure if I would like the salty side but I do.  I got the citrus and brine,  slight smoke... No banana.  I would recommend this all day!","A stalwart.  I had seen OP around but never tried it until I visited the distillery, which incidentally has a very good visitor centre. A very good beginner whisky and a firm favourite of mine.  The slightly salty flavour comes towards the end and the whisky is very smooth. Certainly light and floral and a hint of honey. Very glad I found the distillery in Wick and look forward to trying the older whiskies.","After reading the reviews I was left very disappointed as this was bought as a present for me and it's what I asked for. For me this is the worst malt I have tasted. I got no hint of citrus fruits it left a bitter taste in my mouth and felt very heavy. I would not recommend this malt to anyone","A Bourbon drinker but this Scotch was do smooth and good tasting I may have to switch to this.  Bought at the Distillery, hope I can find another in the USA!","Recommended this whisky by the friendly staff at Whisky Exchange Shop in London. Will definitely be buying again","My daughter brought this home as a present for me from Scotland.  I love her even more now!","I find it very difficult to seriously fault anything that Old Pulteney produce. The 12 yr old is one of my all time favourite affordable whiskies. Huge character beyond its tender years with lots of tropical fruit and a nostalgic hint of seaside air. The 17 and 21 year olds are sublime too!","this is  such a treat that it brought me back to single malts.","How do I love thee?

For the price I don't think you can get a better dram.  Easy-going but with a complexity that keeps you coming back.","A little disappointed with this scotch.. considering how great the reviews are I was expecting something a little more bold.. this seemed a bit thin on the palate and a slight bitter after taste (lines is the best description I would say) a slight saltiness and citrus fruits but nothing fantastic..,it's probably the first single malt that I wouldn't buy again... but I'll certainly finish the bottle!","Have seen mixed reviews...this is an easy going lovely little malt that requires a teaspoon of water to really open up the nose and ease the brine after taste,leaving a little coaster on top for a few minutes optional.In brief on the nose (fruit cake aroma's.)On the palate almond and citrus with slight hints of brine once 1-2 teaspoons of water have been added the flavour really opens up.Very easy to drink,not to complicated and always giving on the flavour.","Salt,lemon,lime and smokey in my opinion not as good as the 21-year.I may come back at a later date to refresh my memory ;-)","Had a glass or two on a trip to Scotland,  liked it so much that I bought a bottle home.\nBest Whiskey I have ever tasted","lovely tipple I must say. This is the one you have if its going to be along night. kind to the palate. It will find space on my top shelf.  Been a whisky drinker for 50 yrs so i think I know a good one, and this is very good.","Beginner nose here and I really like this one. Tried this after starting with a Speyburn 10 yr.  The color is a beautiful amber.  It's mild, not too intense, can get close without burning.  I get a dominant fruitiness. Maybe a little honey. Cinnamon?  I must be mad.  Caught a smokiness too. More so after adding a few drops of water. And the fruit wasn't as dominant afterward, I guess what you'd expect. Others have said citrus - my novice palate didn't get that. However, after adding a little more water, up to about a full teaspoon now, I did get a sense of brine.  Others have said banana which I missed and was then quite surprised...at the very end when I thought it was all over. It was there and gone in an instant, actually kind of exciting.  Finishes quickly. Overall taste, mouthfeel... Velvety in the front for me with a strong bite on the sides of the tongue and a smoothness to the back.","Love this dram excellent for the price. Mostly drink islay whiskies currently but when I want change this is my go to. The fruit flavours are there but very hard to determine, for me its closer to pear than anything else.","Great price, value for money i must say! The noes shows lingering fruity(citrus) sweetness together with malt. No banana though. Medium, spicy, and fruity on the palate, but a hint of bunfire. Real good balance! - aftertaste is well balanced, no sharpness at all. The fruit stays for quiet a long time. ENJOY","I loved this scotch. So refreshing and goes well with a log fire burning next to you.","Wow a 750ml 86 proof single malt 12 yr scotch for under $40?! It seemed too good to be true until I tried it. Spicy, creamy, salty with a little citrous, smokey sweetness and some heat. I'm not tasting the banana but there is a subtle fruit flavor without being overly sweet. I want to add apricot for some reason. It needs a little water or ice to unlock the flavors for the palate to match the nose. The finish is a tad bitter but it doesn't linger and definitely doesn't resemble an immature scotch. It's reminiscent of seawater but I suppose that's its heritage. Either way, it's smooth with a little bite and a flavor that's somewhere between a drier Glenfiddich and fruitier Glenmorangie with more attitude than Red Breast. It's definitely a top choice in its price range with diminishing returns when spending $20 more for something on a higher shelf. This is a must try that could easily turn into a regular sipper. Just grab a bottle as it won't disappoint.","Do yourself a favor and spend an evening with this single malt, would i buy it again?..ohhh..yes..","Nice citrus, creamy, salty and a good finish. It's a buy and a great price.","Salty, creamy, sweet, medium finish and @ 63 CDN.....dam good dram.","The best way that I can describe the main flavour that develops in the mouth is of 'bubbly banana'. A very smooth and refreshing taste indeed.","Bananas, malt, honey and sea salt. Interesting aroma. The taste is even more interesting. I've been a whisky drinker for a long time and I have come to prefer those with a unique taste like this one. I just can't understand why it doesn't have more of a reputation. It's very hard to find in the USA and I live I in New York City. I highly recommend this","Wether you're a new whisky drinker or an experienced malt maniac, this is a great whisky. And for the price, it's real value for money; amazing price! Enjoy!","One of the best Single malts around in the price area! Smooth and rich tasting - pleasure to sip !","Appreciative of the crafting that goes into this fine scotch. I find it great on the whole, maybe a little underwhelming on the palate compared to the nose and finish but still a great drinking experience.","If you are or ever were a Royak Marine you will know  what I mean when I say, this malt is Hoofing ,the is no better accolade .","Having read the review's I agree that the addition of just a few drops of water brings the Smokey and Salty notes out and smooths out to a lovely long finish.","The best single malt i ever tried at the price! And there was quite a lot :)","Beautifully nice drink, no bitter after taste.\nA pleasure to drink from the first drop to the last.","The initial dry nose is almost a challenge. You aren't sure just how it is going to end up. But boy does it end up nice.","One of the best single malt whiskey I have tasted \nHighly recommended!","Great taste,worth it for the price.","Stunning, beautifully smooth with a delightful hint of the sea","Tried it for the first time last night in Edinburgh absolutely fantastic","This is a magnificent whisky. The smoothness, mouthfeel and the saltiness make it a perfect accompaniment to dark chocolate. I f I was to only have one whisky, maybe this is it.","Excellent value for money. The best single malt I have found at this price level","Usually I am a peaty whisky drinker but a recent tour and tasting of the wifes homeland distillery of Arran has made me think more of other whiskies so when I seen this in ALDIS for ?20.99 I had to buy it and I am so glad I did.As soon as you open the bottle and get a nose you instantly know that this is an exceptional whisky and it just gets better upon tasting.Its so fresh and crisp you would think that it was not made by man but rather discovered rolling over the sea cliffs.A true masterclass  in whisky distillation and maturation!","Firstly, in response to Kim (2009), why not the other way round and have the canister be the same shape as the bottle:)?....Anyway - a superb malt, made out of contrasts that somehow merge perfectly: light yet substantial, salty yet sweetish, simple yet elegant, oaky yet refreshing, the heaviness of the sea yet the lightness of the wind etc etc....Wonderful, though once, and only once, I had a subpar bottle, the alcohol was too hot.","Lovely smell, great clean, crisp taste.  A lot cheaper than other single malts and even better tasting than many.  I''m a big fan of the Islay whiskies and Talisker-OP stands highly alongside them in my opinion.  The brininess is identifiable, but certainly not off-putting, a nice long finish to a dram too.","Superb malt. Simple as that. There is nothing harsh about this dram. Nose surprises every time with orange and a whiff of brine.  If you close your eyes and breathe deeply you almost feel yourself wrapped in north coastal sea air. Palate is butterscotch with a hint of citrus. Finish is long and dry, buttery with a hint of salt. By far and away my favourite sub 14 year old malt.","realy nice and smooth","Needs more cask influence to calm the alcohol that is somewhat detached and sharp on the tongue.Frankly, I am surprised it has a 12 year label as it tastes more like a 6 year old. I take it with ice to calm it down. Its a pity OP can't five it a bit of their 17 year-old magic. I suppose you get what you pay for!","Considering that my Grandmother was born & bred in Wick, this was an absolute must for me. My first ever taste of malt (as I usually drink blends) and I must say this is such an easy-drinking one and amazing value for money too!","Deliciously flavoursome - sweet & enjoyable to share with your very best friends ,\nWell worth a visit to the distillery too !","You must add a drop of water to this. It transforms it into one of the best. Underated but I would not hesitate to recomend it. It is very well made.","This single malt stands out on many levels. Great value. Great provenance. Great uniqueness of character. And of course great aroma, taste, texture and finish. What would it be like at 43 or 46%, un-chillfiltered and non-caramelized (E150)..? The mind boggles, as it is already, despite all the branding, a whisky that magically stays true to its provenance and just delivers time after time! And oh, yeah, another of it's great strengths is the consistency, bottle after bottle, year after year...","Bought my first bottle a couple of weeks ago based on decent reviews and when I tried it I was quite disappointed, finding it a bit bland. Now the bottle has been open a week or so and after sampling again I was pleasantly surprised. I still found it light and delicate but it's a distinctive malt and I would love to try the 17yr and 21yr next.","Big sherry presence? This whisky is matured in ex-bourbon casks. Great dram for the money though. just wish it was given a craft presentation.","Clean and zingy, very fresh. Some peat but also honey and nuts. I did get a little of the salty brine flavour but certainly not unpleasant, for the money I doubt you could pick up anything as complex as this.","Bought this on a whim as I fancied a change from my usual (Laphroaig QC) so glad I did, this is a brilliant dram for the money with such a unique taste. In this price bracket im yet to try anything that compares.","Absolute perfection, a fantastic taste with very little lingering after taste. By far the best I have tasted and my favourite.","A fantastic drop. Prefer over others in its class.","A lovely malt, & you can definitely taste a bit of the sea in this one.

Well balanced but unremarkable.  Good value for money though at this price!","not being a great fan of whiskeys in general, and scotch in particular, i approached my birthdat present with caution. What a revalation !! At last, a single malt I can drink and enjoy! To my uneducated palate it is pleasantly smooth but challenges the taste buds to a duel of flavours. I'll certainly be buying more when this bottle is empty, (won't be long ), and may even stretch to the 21 yr version!!

What was honey and almond on the nose turns to sweet malt and marzipan notes on the palate. However, upon transition to mid-palate the salty brine element becomes abundantly clear, marked by a noted tanginess. \"Finish\": a nutty, slightly honeyed feel, with the oak providing a clean, unobtrusive dryness.","Lovely dram which integrates the bourbon and sherry notes alongside the sea side \/ sea spray which transports you up to Wick. Full bodied and smooth with a long finish a class act. Oh yes don't put ice cubes in it!!! Just a drop or more of water if needed.","Whether new or veteran to single malt, this is a very good whisky. Amazing orange nose slightly diluted, with a cool, refreshing sea spray across the palate, smooth spice, then a nice smoke on the medium finish. You'll want to stock up!","Definitely try it with a splash of water, otherwise tastes and smells a bit dull. Still very good for the price , love the bottle too.","My favourite.

Lovely and smooth, a little salt and sea air, I too drink it strait.","very fine and exceptionally smooth malt.  A good starting point along with the Glenlivet 12 for beginners, as the flavours are easily discernible, with a very light \"burn\".  I use these two to introduce others to the proper appreciation of single malt.  No ice or mixers allowed","One of my favorites. A very unique flavor that combines sweetness and smokiness. Very smooth. Unbeatable value.","This is absolutely an adorable whisky! I usually get a bottle at Christmas. Very nice! I live in Kentucky in Bourbon Whiskey Country, but I still love a good Scotch from time to time. To me, Bourbon and Scotch are \"kissing cousins!\"  :-)","This one has plenty of character, and tells the story of a classic coastal highland whisky.

The distinctive hint of brine makes it a nice change from all the sherried stuff.

IS THIS A DIFFERENT TASTE, OR ALONG THE SIMILIAR TASTE FROM ISLAY?","Beautifully smooth and complex with a lovely finish.  Excellent malt which gives Highland Park a run for its money.","I just tried a miniature, and it really hit me. A couple of ice cubes, few minutes and as soon as you get the glass near your nose you are hit with some light orangey aroma, relaxing and refreshing. Really enjoyable","Distinctive and impressive.

Its a lighter peat with sweet overtones and a complex after taste. Just enjoying a few drams whilst in Thailand.\n","\nFantastic whisky. Fully endorse the other good reviews. Well worth getting a bottle or two. Excellent value.\n","\nVery different, in a good way. Charismatic. Light tang, not a heavy tang of peat, thankfully, keeping this mellow. I might be out on a limb, or there might be variation, but I got two improbable but persistent flavour hints: lavender.. and laugh if you will... some damp but not quite fusty yet... old leather-bound books. Even the smell had a touch of the latter - not a usual whisky aroma by any means. Producer reek and smoke notes and floral mention mean I don't feel I've entirely lost the plot. Haven't tasted anything like it. Other more usual Speyside complexities in there, sweetening it off and always came back to it with relish when the mood struck me and it never disappointed my desire for a left-field moment. Just gets the 5th star, but a steal..\n","\nThis is a malty Speyside dram with just a light hint of peat to add complexity. Still a rounded Speyside malt, nothing like an Islay.

It's young, not complex, a great starter for those dipping their toes into gentle peat. Whispy smoke on the nose with a gentle, underlying candied sweetness. Spicy vanilla palate (as the producer notes say) and a pleasantly long finish. Won't break the bank and not barnstormingly exciting, but solid stuff.","This whiskey was a one time purchase.  Not horrible and not great  It appears young, probably corporate decision to put less expensive single malts on the shelf for quick profits in a craze for single malts. I've certainly tasted better ardmore's!","Not the best to be honest, it is very smooth and isn't too smoky but it just lacks flavour","I enjoyed it. Peaty and smoky but not over the top. Lovely light colour. I think it fits nicely amongst my highland single malts, well, if I wasn't always drinking them. I liked it. Send a barrel my way x","Pretty poor. Blandness of a young whisky which presumably it is. Much better whiskys at this price point.","Thought I\u2019d give this one a try, liked the mild peaty nose and taste to suit, clung to the glass which was a good thing.\nNot as overpowering as some of the island malts, not a favorite, though grand for the price......","This scotch is a NIGHTMARE!

It tasted like surgical spirit!!","Disappointed, smoke on the nose, smoke on the tongue, not much more, a wee sweet toffee at the end. Too smokey.","Peaty smokey flavour great first hit on the palette very enjoyable","Its a 3.5 to 4 rating. As one already said its no Laphroaig but the flavours are nice and smooth. I suggest enjoying a glass or two while a lady kisses the land down under","Beyond the other flavours, I like the Smokey pervasiveness","Rather strong on the nose.The Speyside grass\/heather is quite prominent. First smoke then peat, but not in the Islay mould; less dominant. Spices easily nosed, unmistakeable cinnamon. A teaspoon of water brings out the latent sweetness. On the palate, tangy with a lot of blowback. Quickly toned down with water. Honey comes to the forefront and oaky vanilla is obvious. Grass changes to Cancerian fruit, probably green apple. Lasting sweetness as you move into the finish. Spices recede first but the warm peaty aftertaste remains. Good value for money. I can still taste the body of this dram 10 minutes after downing it.","Worst Single Malt I ever tasted. It's taste like medicine instead of Single Malt.","I am very disappointed! Ardmore was one of my top 5 favorite whiskies, It was always hard to find it in the US, I used to get it from the duty free and truly enjoy the malt. I just came across this 40% ABV new bottle about bought it immediately. I have had a dram sitting in the glencairn glass for an hours and there's absolutely nothing happening to it. No character, no development and the body is weaker than any other whisky I can think of. They have killed a great thing and why?","My bottle has no finish.  Well, very little.  Just a wisp of smoke and done.  Initial taste and nose is very promising, but then a huge let down.  I'd almost rather have a less interesting malt that holds up.  So sad for one of my favorite malts (previous bottling).  The good news is that there are still good indie bottlings of Ardmore that are worth going back to.","Peat, peaty peat, peat peat peaty, peaty peat peaty, germoline peaty pants","Sweet with peat. Great value at the price. Other people's negative comments probably come from those who are not used to peaty whiskies. This is often the case with negative reviews of popular Islay malts. Customer who likened Talisker to a peaty whisky has not tried a truely peaty whisky. Ardmore has a gentle peatyness and I was surprised at its quality at this low price.","Great value for the price, although light on the \"peat\" claim. This was nice once I got about 3 drinks in, the taste -although lighter- was very sippable. I did not taste or smell much for the peat, even compared to Bowmore Small Batch or 12 yo. Excellent value considering it goes for what blended Scotches usually are and is much nicer.","Quite good. Smoke and toffee are predominant and that's all there is to it, flavour wise.  It's just that there's some alcohol harshness...  I've tasted a few blended scotches that had less burn.  There are far better whiskies at this price-point.  Bought it because it was on offer at a supermarket and it was a good buy at that price but would not pay full price for it.  Managed to finish the bottle in two weeks, which is good going for me, so it can't be all that bad.","Superb","I agree that it is dry.  The taste is new to me, but is okay.","overpowering peaty malt whisky i did not enjoy it cheaper malts like glen moray and shieidhaigh taste better","For the price, this is a great introductory whisky. In fact, this was the first single malt that was bought for me.  A great tasting whisky but the long harsh after taste just takes the edge off it. Still a good single in my opinion and maybe I should have tried a dash of water to see what effect that would have of the end flavour.","Great taste and flavour. Peaty and smoky and dried fruit. Ruined by such a harsh alcohol aftertaste. So much potential but let down in the end","Not a bad drop, had better, however had a lot worse. If you think it tastes like Germoline, There's something wrong with your mouth.","I bought my first ever bottle yesterday. Money is a bit tight this month so I thought I would take a chance. What a most pleasant surprise. Admittedly it's not an Ardbeg or a Laphroaig but this really is a very palatable dram. Extremely difficult to understand the negative comments.","just tried this today in York, very moreish and i totally agree with Stuart P's description...i got a bottle in my collection now and soon i'm gonna enjoy it even more","Thought this was horrible as did my wife. Although we don't generally like smokey peaty malts we have enjoyed a few tallisker being one but this as another person said is like germoline. Sorry not for us.... ??","While it's a nice drink I'm confused as to how it's classed as a single malt.","A perfect accomliment to a fine cigar. It provides a warmth that may not suit all and a perfect reminder of what a single malt should be. Smokey, peat, oaky and a lovely lingering after taste.\nBut that could be the Ardmore speaking","So sorry, but this is the worst I have tasted. It smells and tastes like Germoline. I don't know whether I have got a faulty bottle but it has made me ill. Reading other comments, it is obvious that the whisky has gone down well with other people. I have had many other brands that have been highly satisfactory but this brand is not to my taste.","Beautiful subtle smoke, very woody but smooth and moreish. Can't wait to try more","Beautiful subtle smoke, very woody but smooth and moreish.

Sometimes it can take me a couple of glasses to decide whether I'm a fan but with this one instantly loved it. Full of flavour with a hint of peat. Really nice smokiness to it that lingers. Really worth a try. I think I've found my new favourite.","An absolute gem of a find that can be enjoyed by everyone. Extremely well balanced combination  of smoke, vanilla and sweet apple.","Mighty fine dram indeed, and an absolute bargain at the moment! My new go to whisky!","The prominent smokey flavour definitely hit the spot for me. This is one of the best bottles I have ever had.","In comparison to the traditional cask I find this a completely different dram, it''s not as earthy and there is less smoke to it, don''t get me wrong the traditional is a classic and it''s a shame they no longer make it, but this is a lovely new drop with a lot of potential, don''t get put off by the NAS label, this has wonderful sweetness to it with the heather coming through strongly in the nose and the honey is very prominent in the taste with a subtle smoke then the finish isn''t prolonged but really delivers with satisfaction.

I had asked another friend to buy me a Lagavulin. Much as I love the Lagavulin, the Cask Islay was a revelation for me. Intense, peaty but not too much, smoky but not too much. Just gorgeous. When I\u2019d worked my way through the bottle, I noticed that the (more expensive) Lagavulin was only half empty. I placed an order for two more bottles of Cask Islay at what I thought was a very fair price for something so delightful. What more can I say? Just try it.\n","\nBought this 6 months ago and just opened it. A real (pleasant!) surprise. Light to medium peat with pepper, citrus and juniper notes. Smells more spirit driven than is tastes. On the palate it's a lot more refined, orange zest and wood smoke with a lingering finish. 4.5\/5 - Very good value and will buy again.\n","\nOMG, to be honest i am not expert but to me this smelt like a cleaning substance from a hospital, the taste just as bad, don't get me wrong i am sure for a lot this is a good one but not for me . Can any one guide me to another whiskey to try not this style. 3 stars as sure it will suit someone.\n","\nHaven't opened this bottle yet, but I've had it before. It's a classic Islay malt with a particularly smooth finish, and smoke and coal tar lingering in the background so not in your face like some. I love it, very drinkable......perhaps too drinkable!\n","\nIt has a smoothness to it that I really like, along with what seems like a medium-level of peatiness. The 46% adds to the bite, which is also nice. Overall a great combination of smoothness and bite and smoke but still not too sweet.\n","\nThis is a nice easy starter for those who want to know what peat\/smoke is in a Scotch. Its not overwhelming and its easy to drink. Its also affordable. I would highly recommend this to anyone.\n","\nTicks the peat For Christmas box nicely - a surprise present from a family friend. Welcome contrast to The Quinta Ruban Glenmo which ticks the liquid Chtistmas pud box.The fun thing about this dram( an award winner it says on the box ) is how it brings out The whisky geek in me. I sort of concur with alexlovesaredbeg. I did a mental elimination process and ended up on the North East coast of Islay. I would guess it;s either Caol Ila, or a peated Bunna - Reminds me of one I bought at duty free with a fancy Gaelic name...a milder peat than the south shore Islays, A bit more rounded. Very good value for money. I;d say you ain;t paying for the name...\n","\nIt's brilliant. I think it's Caol Ila :) The smoky, cured meat smell with some fruity notes. Phenolic, slightly peppery with some dark chocolate. Peaty to the right degree. I love it, especially for the price!\n","\nThis is not a whisky for the faint hearted. It has a real whallop of peat and heat that goes on and on, with some soft fruit in the background. Would be fascinated to know where it comes from, instinct says it's from the high peat end of the distilleries so Caol Ila or maybe even Ardbeg - so the first reviewer is right, this bruiser is really good value for money. The only reason I've not given five stars is it lacks that bit of class to be the very best but a definite 4.5\n","\nThis is a cracking whisky, tasted this recently and was well impressed. To me if this whisky had the distillers label it would cost a lot more than a mere thirty two pounds. The flavour is powerful and full bodied not unlike a Caol lla.

Beautifully smooth, almost honeyed but with that smoky-peat flavour that distinguishes all good single malts - and it warms the insides wonderfully as it goes down!","I grew up in Germany tasting incredible award winning Schnapps. I barely ever get to enjoy the flavor of this spirit here in the States. When I smelled this scotch, I was immediately reminded of the sugary yet subtle  fruit note of Mirabellen Schnapps. Light, warm, sweet, bright and very drinkable.","A straightforward whisky with a bit off saltiness and spicyness throughout. Very clean and refreshing. Adding water brings out a slightly floral taste.","A straightforward no nonsense whisky with slight peatyness and a bit of matured fruit taste.","One of two whiskies that introduced me to the world of single malt whisky. A smooth, somewhat sweet and enjoyable dram. Not really peated, but a small hint. Bargain of a whisky that I really enjoy and would recommend to anybody, particularly if new to whisky.","Absolutely lovely.","I really like this whisky, it's got very strong flavours and is exceptional value for money, I usually have at least one bottle per month and it's consistently refreshing","Stunning, a beautiful drink. A smooth drink but not lacking in flavors!!","First time tonight wonderful.  I am not a full on Island fan but not against, Speyside normally first choice. This is the best of both styles with an added something, a great discovery for me","Smells of salt, oak, dried fruit, hint of peat. Easy to drink, soft on the palate, tastes of toffee, dried fruit, oak, hint of smoke and peat. Smooth, brief finish. A good dram.","This was a surprise.  I was expecting a quality that matched the low price, but Whoa!  This is a delicious well-balanced scotch with strong vanilla and caramel notes.  No smoke.  Fans of The Balvenie will appreciate the quality and flavor ... and LOVE the price.","Excellent.  Worth every cent","This is the best tasting scotch for the money. Has very delicate finish. Not bitey.","This is good stuff with a unique taste, if not your typical island malt.  This is no peat or brine anywhere.  On the nose there is something damp like a wet field.  Barley mixed with hay.  On the palate it is sweet.  There is malt with vanilla.  This has a honeyed and slightly oily feel.  The finish is of medium length and warming with spice mixing in.  Not the most complex but nice.  I like sherry and peat, but every now and again I want something plain.  This might be an island whisky but in my opinion it most resembles Auchentoshen 12","was my favorite single malt and my GO TO everyday scotch. VERY disappointed with the recipe changes.","Flavorful & smooth. Moderately priced for good quality.  Can compete with brands that cost 3x more or higher.","Received a bottle as a gift; really enjoying it. Smooth, soft texture. Very easy to drink, no harshness or acidic taste. Simple, smooth and more-ish.","Very drinkable and lovely honey taste","After watching  a T\/V prog  tours of the islands.  She visited Jura with  only 1 distillery on the land. Well I had to try it . glad I did , i love it . Its not a heavy on the palate drink its one of those that has its place any time of day tipple. its got my vote.  Glenfiddich is still my top shelf best  and this is now  my day time fave  . Scotland  does not make a poor whiskey and its got a dram for all tastes and this is another fine example of the trade in what they do best. I shall buy it again .","Smooth and sweet","Not bad bit of a harsh finish but pleasant and enjoyable. I find that with this drink a double will last me a long time due to the long finish. I would buy this again but only if the price is right.","Beautiful , smooth, easy drinking.Caramel on the nose.Vinious in character.Slightly sweet on the finish.","liquorice root and toffee","Taste is good but take it with water or only ice","This is excellent and for its price point hard to match. This is one of my top picks for a non-peaty scotch.","I'm drinking this at this moment and it's smooth, light....Lovely","A quite, mellow whisky. It glides smoothly over the taste buds, rather than attacking them. Very pleasant.","Lovely and easy to drink straight.","Good staple malt to have in. Nothing fancy and doesn't pretend to be. Easy to drink and good value.","A wee bit disapointing,Ihave drunk a lot of other brands and must say this one does\"nt come up to scratch tastes like a good blend","Light but with plenty of taste too -a real winner","I have tried many single malts but return to this time and again, smooth and warming, quiet beauty.","I liked this and had no inclanation to add water. Really matched description given on box gentle light etc I would expect this to be agreeable with most but those conisuers looking for that sensory adventure.","Not a bad drink, but didn''t really excite me like others have. I think I shall have to try a few more glasses and make a second judgement","I couldn''t believe at start. In my small town in Serbia, I found Jura Origin in pack with two cups. This whisky is really amazing and his taste reminds me of Glenfiddich Solera 15.","It is still one of my favorite malts. Great sweetness and creamy viscosity.   I have spent more on many single malts and enjoyed them much less. Love the other Jura whiskies as well.","Too good","A cut above a blended whisky; far more complex. Smooth and light.","I''m drinking this right now, and it''s smooth, light, and whiskey. Which is what I paid for, but then again, everyone''s different.","Very Light and firm whisky and aged so good all be frankly I had a half bottle and I didn''t feel a thing the next day. Real good","I received this as a present this week and after tasting it, I wasn''t that impressed. Nosing it left me with sharp tingling sensations instead of the usual warm feeling.\n\nTasting it I got a strong flavour of liquorice and bourbon. Not my favourite but bearable.","Beautiful whisky. Lovely taste with a hint of honey. Not everything needs to be peaty... Very smooth and morish!","Not Much Appreciating...comparatively a young whisky, 10yrs old..I personally don''t like it though hv a smooth go on our pallet..needs to get bottled minimum at 12yrs of age..tastes like a blended whisky not at all Malty...","I''ve tried lots of malts over the years and generally enjoyed them all but not keen on this at all. It''s insipid not smooth and tastes like a cheap blend.","What had the potential to be a superb single malt, is utterly ruined by being so watered down.  Such a shame.","Very smooth","Very nice cast hint of smoke and no after taste . A winner at a low cost .","Lovely drink. My father in law nearly choked when he saw the price after we''d sunk half a bottle!","Nice","best whisky I  ever tasted","its nice and smooth","excellent whisky that comes at a very good price. what strikes me about it is that it has that salty, iodide, seaside character that comes from its marine roots, but also a strong body which I like in highland whiskies. I enjoy it very much!","Opened bottle of origin last week for my birthday the wife bought me \u2013 nectar","Opened a bottle of this tonight which my son bought me for my birthday, must say that I found it a pleasant drop, sweet and easy to drink neat. By the way it is whisky not whiskey :(","Jura is often available on special offer in some major UK supermarkets; which makes it great value. It has a unique distinct flavour profile, that includes fresh and cheerful vanilla toffee with a short finish. I love that they sell half bottles on special offer. Great value in it's price range.","I completely agree with Jamie H's review....very nice, but I think I would buy Aberlour or Glenmorangie again over this.","Very smooth and easy to drink, I would try any whisky with a few spots of water for comparisons purposes and have found in many cases it brings out more aromas, in this case it just ripped the taste out of it. A top quality whisky highly recommended on it's own!","there is no sutch thing as a bad whiskey its just some are better than others. i am poor & for the price this is exalent","I have tried dozens of single malts over the years and the 10 years old Jura remains my favorite. As a matter of fact that is the only whiskey I drink for the last several years. I keep other single malts for the house guests and offer Jura only to very close friends.","LOVE IT i've tried many malts all a little different and unique...cant fault this one tho you should try superstition as well,but be warned....its VERY easy to drink !!","Really the peaty smell is obnoxious it's great in taste style and surpasses all other scotches,it's magic with  tast and marvellous in aroma","Out of the fifty or so different whisky\u2019s I\u2019ve tried so far this is the only one I couldn\u2019t drink. It does have a very unique flavour to it but unfortunately it is not one that I could appreciate.","For the price there is nothing wrong with this whiskey at all yes you could pay a little more and buy a JW black label which is better. However if you are really going to pay more go for the Jura 16 year old you will not be disappointed and worth every penny for the experience","My review of 7th May 11 was a little harsh. My taste in single malts has moved away from Islay's and I'm now beginning to appreciate the sweet, honeyed tones of this whisky. So much so, in fact, that I've just ordered a bottle of 16 year old to compare !","Easy enough to drink and wasn't disappointed (especially for the price). Probably won't buy another bottle though. Aberlour 10yo a much better option.","Im pretty new to whisky in general, but I have tried a good few of the mainstream single malts i.e Glenfiddich, Penderyn, Glenmorangie etc, and I have to say this far out guns most single malts in this price range. YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS! Beautiful on the nose, very smooth and has a great depth of flavours.","jura is bit too strong tasting for me and putting ice with it seems to turn it to a rude smelling peat - bit of warm water vastly improves it bringing out the sweet honey.","My favorite 'drinking' Whisky. \u00a321.95 here is an excellent price as I've just paid \u00a329.95 for a bottle! (a downfall of living in the Inner Hebrides lol). If you like this then move up a grade to Superstition - I'm on a quest to sample many more Jura expressions (and live 500 metres from the Ledaig distillery!)","Firstly great value for your cash \u00a320 not bad! easy drinking lovely sweet nose ,honey, slight salt,citus fruits and a wiff of summer breezz. A good starting point for any up and cumming Whisky buff.","Good, warming, nice after taste, with a heavenly nose","I tried Jura 10 year old single malt for the first time today and found a whisky which has a good nose and an accessable and subtle flavour taken straight. \nAdd a drop of water and other pleasurable aspects develope.\nHoney after-taste, though with a somewhat short finish. \nOverall however, a very good dram!","very good","Hmmmmm, is 'bland' too strong a word for this tipple? Ok, i take it back, how about 'uninteresting'. Sorry. Agree with anonymous, 11th Nov '10 - \"I've tried at least 50 different kinds of whiskey so far and this is the only one I can't say anything good about\".","I'm a lover of rare and high end malts especially Mortlach and Aberlour.... I've just bought a bottle of this Jura 10yo and find it absolutely unique: Heather, Honey and Coffee Beans on the nose with a light and very well balanced arrival, white pepper and parchment phase with a tobacco and flint finish. Citrus, honey,tobacco and coffee beans linger... Anybody who doesn't enjoy this is clearly entitled to their tastes and opinions.... more left for those who appreciate it.","Those who speak with anonimoty obviously don't want to defend their review, some must think the job of tasting is to be a critic. Found out about Jura while whiskey shopping, I asked questions and read the updated Scotch Whiskey Bible. Niether were critical so I purchased and must say enjoyed the subtle differences from other single malts, different isn't worse or better it's just different. An enjoyable adventure.","I'd say that everyone should drink their whisky how they want - try it without ice, but if you prefer it with ice then go for it.","beautiful, delicatley smokey, sweet, smooth, vanilla and burnt caramel, takes the edge of the day. To the lad who drank this with ice, this is a big NO NO","More like a bourbon than a whisky,very disappointed","I'm 23 and have only really ever drink southern comfort as I don't yet like the taste of whisky my Dad drinks, but someone bought him Jura as a present and it's a very nice whisky to start on for a beginner. And my dad likes it! It's not too harsh on the throat and is very tasty with some ice. I will be buying a bottle when I've drunk my Dads!!","I was maybe a little harsh. This 10 yr old is certainly not as complex as some, but with time and breathing itd matures into a nicely accessible and pleasant dram. Its certainly not complex or suprising as some and does have a rather short finish, but its pleasant and actually quite lovely as an after dinner dram. I admit when I'm wrong, and love it when I am. This whisky would be good for a novice looking to explore the world of single malts. A nice dram !","First taste and impressions are that this isn't as complex as some unpeated whisky's. To be honest, it feels flat and the taste disappears too quickly for my liking. I don't like being negative about products because someone has put their heart and soul into producing the bottle that currently sits in drinks cabinet. Maybe I'll appreciate 10 yr old Jura with time, but I'll stick to my unpeated malts such as 12 yr old Old Pulteney and 15 yr old Dalwhinnie in future.","A fair single malt. A progressive nose with an initial trace of menthol, giving way to a brackish character","lovely easy to drink and not to harsh on the throat nice and sweet and lovely smell to it","Not bad. A bit salty, and an undefinable but distinctive (or 'peculiar', if I were feeling mean) taste in there somewhere. Light and easy to drink. Pleasant, but unremarkable. Obviously better than the bad end of blended stuff, but if had to choose between this and JW Black at the same price I would take the JW Black without hesitation. Worth a go if it were steeply discounted and your liquorist had unaccountably run out of Teacher's.","Very easy drinking single malt. Surprising for an Island in how smooth it is, very good place to start with single malts.","Very, very light and delicate. Must be drunk on a totally clean palate to appreciate its subtle flavours.","couldnt even stand the smell of whiskey until a friend encouraged me to try this.am now fully converted to the joys of whiskey","Let's be honest here, everyone who has tasted more then 20 different whiskies knows this isn't the best whisky in the world.Then again...maybe it is.Let's take a closer look, this is a very simple and honest whisky. The nose gives away some nice wood, barley and sea influences, the flavour gives an honest barley taste with some hints of buttery candy treats. The only thing lacking is stamina, the flavour is very short and it does not develop any further.","Fantastic single malt very smooth and very very easy to drink.","Jura genius if you buy this whiskey. Full of flavour. Took it to my friends to taste with him and he said 'Jura good guy for buying me this'.","I've tried at least 50 different kinds of whiskey so far and this is the only one I can't say anything good about.","Where have I been for the past 50 years. Reasonably successful, happily married, faithful dog but never discovered JURA until now.   Wow what a drink. Sublime. Never mind the cough mixture throat medicine ones ( you know which I mean ) if there is one thing you must try before you die it's the heavenly nectar that is JURA whisky.  You'll want to live forever.","I am usually a blend drinker (Johny Walker Black) so what a nice surprise from a single malt (Jura 10 year old). Definitely one of my new favourites.","Well... this stuff tastes more like blended whiskey than single malt. This is not very ambitious malt. The nose is oddly cheesy and there is hanging around a disturbing menthol finish. I won't buy again, sorry.","I enjoy my single malt and find Jura very enjoyable. Right up there with my favorits. Smooth","i dont really like whisky but this was sumthin else, really pleasant drink i will defo try it again","Just added to my single malt collection.  This is one the wife and I enjoy together as it has a gentle enough flavor for her, and enough kick for me.","Please note, these comments have been edited and some posts removed due to an outbreak of petty mudslinging.  Please try to contain yourselves and respect each others opinions.  Thanks.","My first foray into the world of single malts and I thoroughly  enjoyed it!!! Very easy to drink and a lovely peaty taste, recommended.","This is a nicely worked whisky. It has a Highland richness, Speyside delicateness, with a faint jura peat. probably too sweet for many, but, I like it.","I fully agree with uuulala above! It really takes you away with its sweety mildness.","I purchased this as it was on offer at a local superstore. I thought I would try something different. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Another malt that does what it says on the tin.","When in France I had another version of this 10yo, i.e. Iura 10yo Legacy.It was mor sweet, sherried with fuller palate and longer, more warming finish. Amazing.TWE guys, please, get it for us!","not the best wiskey but for the price not to bad .Got a bit of a kick","It is mild, and not rough. To be tasted in summer, not in winter. You can empty a bottle without notice, so mild it is. It is boring if you are young and look for tough experience. The first glass tastes cheap for first 5 minutes, until your wife and kids leave you alone. Then the journey begins.Absolutely no smoke. Not rich in flavour. Delicate.","At $19 with two tumblers included I decided to make up my own mind about this much maligned product. Lots of honey in the nose, pulls its punches on the palate and a very polite slightly smokey finish.  Do not add even a drop of water, since it is a delicate dram.","Smooth, easy to drink and sensibly priced. Surely nobody could be offended by it.","If only we were of the same tongue,how boring would that be,however i found this malt pleasing on mine with soft overtones and a slightly sweet finish,floral to the nose,pleasant languishing aftertaste,most enjoyable.","I agree with Andrew fae Auchtermuchty .","i also regretted buying this, it isnt too bad but it just seems a bit bland","I agree with Stevee. This tasted cheap and unmemorable.","One of my favourite island malts. Easy to drink and with a taste to die for.","A boring whisky that tastes cheap. I regretted buying this, although I did manage to force it all down ;-)","Jura was my first experience with an island malt and it was good! Smooth, rich, a little salt, mildly sweet, and a hint of smoke. Well worth a try!!!

Comparing to Nectar,  the Original is significantly rough. But ok  by it\u2019s own..","Smooth, doesn't let you down, is sweet and balanced. It's amazing that among single malts, even the less expensive are outstanding. Glenmorangie has great value for its price, and is never a disappointing scotch to have a dram of.

I don\u2019t care for smokiness or peatiness as it tastes like TCP to me, but I recognise that others think differently and that is fine. I like smooth whiskies and this is an excellent and affordable example. I saw a review once that suggested MacCallan Gold was for people who don\u2019t like whisky. These are the words of an idiot.

Very smooth and creamy.","(Disclaimer: I've only been drinking Scotch for a year now, so my palate is as about as refined as a monster truck show. )This has to be the most gentle whiskey ever made!

I'm a Scotch guy gone coganac.  Bought this for my wife. Sweet, smooth with tones of vanilla and honey. Reminds me of a developed Remy. These guys are unbelievably dedicated to their craft.","Being from Kentucky I'm more accustomed to my native Bourbon whiskey.  Frankly I wanted to branch out a little. Honestly I find this scotch amazing. The many different flavors I experience when drinking this to my untrained palate.  Are a hint a vanilla, citrus maybe a nutty flavor. Not sure. But one thing is sure I love it!","Smooth and sweet.  I immediately smelled the citrus.  The finish is fantastic.","Very smooth. Lots of honey. Like it","Easy to drink, very fruity.","Creamy sweet style with floral, coffee and nutty undertones..complex. Very little if peat and very ltd smoke. Nice if you enjoy sweet whiskey as I did a few years ago as this is a better one not to be wasted as a mixer.  But having now abandoned all borbon I'm now finding my palate is now doing the same for sweeter styles of whiskey. This isn't dry or peated enough for me now so will be last bottle for some time.  My go to now is laphroig 10 year, which ironically is sweeter than in the past but still 10\/10 on the dry scale of whiskey.

Clean.. Sweet.. Crisp.. A must in any mans whiskey collection. Perfect","Far from a stand out whisky, although it's not a poor drink by any means.

Maybe a bit dry is all.","I wasn't sure what to think when I opened this. I was expecting to be punched in the face with peat and burn.\n\nThe aroma is inviting. The taste is sweet but gentle enough to not make this like a fruity mix drink. The color is pleasing. \n\nThis is a great alcohol for an astounding price that can easily be added to any party you visit or kept at home for when you need something on the rocks after a long day.","Outstanding and it's mild.","first time I've tried this one very moreish has smell almost like d smell of cake cooked with orange zest when it comes out of oven, fast is malty but with  vanilla icecream left in the mouth once swallowed really delicious would recommend good value for money","In my opinion this is the best whisky of this style. Malty mixed with toffee, fruit and a delicious nuttiness on the finish. For many people Glenlivet and Glenfiddich are their introduction to songs malt scotch whisky. They were my first single malts after years of drinking blends, Irish whiskey and bourbon. It should be this. I like all styles of single malt whisky. This is my favorite amongst the lighter malty whiskies. Anyone who favors light whiskies who haven't tried this need to.","When I tasted it by the first time, I felt something familiar, a whisky that I tasted before, the tyrconnel single malt NAS. In my opinion, G10yo is a good refreshing malt, but what I expect, even not being an expert, is something better that tastes like a malt like this one, but with more flavour and more delicious, even with less body (if so, with body, even better) e.g. Miyagikyo or Yamazaki.","Very nice, with the right sweetness, balanced and a touch of fire. Fantastic for those wanting a sweeter  taste","Great single malt for the price!","I can finally affordably drink my problems away, after another depressing day while look somewhat classy.  It's hard to stop drinking this hell water","This is a delicious whisky. It is a great value and happens to be better than any whisky of this style, most of which cost much more","One of my favourite well balanced malt best for every day dram !!","It has just the right amount of burn.","While not the very best malt whisky, it's very good, straight (I like the bite), or with just a little water (my wife doesn't). Nicely balanced, good tastes come through, and a lovely finish. There's none better, or even as good, at that price. Our everyday whisky.","Sweet and fruity, very gentle, clean and balanced. Excellent.","This is one of my all time favorites. It's well balanced (for my taste).","I just purchased a bottle of the glenmorangie 10 year original and I can't wait to burst it open, but just out of interest, do these bottles increase in value much if I was to keep it sealed. (10\/years or so) sorry if I offend anybody with silly questions","This is the whisky which navigated me away from peat in favor of great balance.  Fantastic bright notes, not-overly-sweet finish.  Highly recommended.","Great scotch at a reasonable price.","I was raised in the Spey Valley area, I have been drinking malts for about 25 years now (legally anyway). I have tried hundreds of malts from over peaty Islay whiskies to heather, honey, citrus, sea salted etc. I always come back to my glen, its like my long lost best friend every time I buy a bottle. Sure it''s simple, not pretentious (though the tasters description is) It''s helped me through rough times, tough times and love. I actually like the lack of peat, the sweet honey taste (with a drop of h20). \nThey have simply got it right with this simple pure whisky. \nI don''t agree its just for beginning single malt drinkers, it''s a dram for any liquor cabinet, happy times and friends.","I love the Smoky flavor","Wonderfully rich and complex with a delicious sweet, fruity and floral character and subtle hints of spice around the edges. It''s hard to believe that a scotch of this quality is so affordable. An essential dram.","Smother the Glenlivet easer on the palate then Glenfedich.","It has a very sweet citrus-honey notes with a burst of alcoho, wonderful aromas. The palate is very floral,  medium sweet with oak coming in the back, a slight tingling sensation in the nose and a medium long spicy and oaky finish. A satisfactory malt, worth the money.","An unbelievable Scotch that is still somehow affordable considering its high-quality. The nose is gorgeous...a rich and complex bouquet of spiced Christmas oranges, cloves, honey. Whereas I found my Aberlour 10 had a gentle nip of a burn near the end, this one definitely has a fiery bite to it. Renowned as being incredibly complex, this is a Scotch you definitely want to try.","I love the peaty, smoky Islays, and I also love the honeyed Balvanies, and omg, the Glenrothes Vintage 1985! And because I can''t be shelling out for the Nikka Yoichi (smoke & cherries!) more than once a year, the Glenmorangie Original (10-year) is my everyday. A teensy bit of pure water, and its floral character comes up so nicely. There is nothing better for the price.","One of the best drops available in this price range if not the best. In any standard sort of pub this will always be my first port of call. A good introductory whiskey for new comers and I always recommend it. Suitable for all tastes","Its sweetness came as a surprise. It was a nice surprise at first but I liked it less by the next drink.","Gamechanger. This is a whisky for people who think they don't like whisky","Fantastic toffee and vanilla flavours with some discreet floral notes. A morish and accessible whisky that should be tried by all.","Very nice, the perfect way to conclude a hot summers day.","Smooth on the palate, vanilla on the nose, light and easy whisky. Good pre dinner dram. In terms of Highland whisky's I personally prefer Old Pulteney 12.","This whiskey is very palatable and it is the only one i can drink easily.","If its the first thing you go to, then you will be impressed by its complexity and smell. If you're more familiar with whisky, or are tasting a few, this one comes out near the bottom for me. There's a lot of whiskys with far more interesting flavours and smells going on - for me this one is weak in comparison.","Lovely & smooth,,,very \"moreish\".","Too much citrus, not for me.","I recommend this for beginner whisky drinkers. \n\nThe flavour is perfectly balanced. It is sweet and complex without being overpowering. The fragrance is wonderful.\n\nI would definately recommend people that a searching for a balanced whisky to try this first before something like Jura Origins.","Lovely stuff. I agree with the comment below. Hints of orange. Almonds too. Yummy. And so warm!","Very delicious. Orangey (get it, \"GlenmORANGIE?\"), lemony, and delightful. I can see why it's so popular.","A tad 'young' and depthless (is that a word? lol) for a serious drinker, but nevertheless pretty good for light sipping ..","This is a decent, light and safe. It won't blow you away but won't break the bank if you want to give it a try.","A fantastic dram. Sit back, and relax with a fresh and very easy to drink single malt.","Taste buds almost destroyed by Johnny Walker Red. Coaxed into a lasting relationship with Dimple. Then I heard the grown-ups talking about single malts. Bought Laphroaig. Tastes like Creosote (used to retard rotting of fence-posts). Then came a litre of Glenmorangie Original. The education of my palette has begun; I may need multiple tastings of the Glenmorangie before moving on. Don't like the packaging? Get a life.","Rose Flower, Vanilla, Almond, hints of bonfire night. Elegant, Sublime. Only two rivals, The Glenlivet, and Jamesons Tripple Distilled. Well worth \u00a327, ide pay considerably more for this gorgeous dram. Its young and supple.","A good ol' dram. Up there with Glen Livet as one of the best I've tried.","Really enjoyed this malt.  A lot like a Lowlander to me: sweet and floral.  Candy corn, apricot, buttery mashed potatoes.  Must be what a bee feels like when gathering nectar.  There's something familiar about this whisky.  Like deja vu.  Whatever it is, I like it.","A truly wonderful scotch. Full of vanilla and toffee. Wonderfully sweet and a little bit spicey. Superb.","im sorry but glenmorangie is a fab drink","This is one of my favourites - nutty, fruity and moreish - beautiful","A suberb malt. Needless to say I bought 2 litres","don't u get it. glenmORANGIE means orange thus the orange box!!","If I had to describe this whisky in one word it would be \"safe\". It's a decent, light sweet whisky, that's pretty agreeable and isn't really going to offend anyone like a Talisker might. However, for me, it stops at decent, there's nothing really that stands out and grabs you and commands you to drink it, like a Lagavulin or an Aberlour. This is one for the newcomers to the spirit I think.","After just starting to get in to single malts and loving, Talisker and Cragganmore in particular, I did not know what to make of this (to my tastes) rather effete drink, I have tried very hard to like it, I have done all sorts of crazy scientific stuff, water drops, warming glass in hand etc etc.. but I guess it is just to subtle for my earthier spicier tastes.","Just finished off the bottle and all I can say is you can\u2019t go wrong with this. This is the first Malt Whisky that I have ever had and I love it. With that said I do agree with the other reviews that the new packaging is ridiculous.As for the Producer's Tasting Notes\u2026 the only thing that was missing is that the Italian garden wasn\u2019t in outer space\u2026 Yeah they must have hired a poet that has never tasted a drop of Whisky in his life.","This is a big WOW, O-My-God what an amazing bottle of happiness this is. imagine coming home from a stressful day at work and sitting back in your favourite armchair with a glass of THIS 10yr old Glenmorangie, the smoothest bottle of happiness I've ever tested. What an amazing whisky, this has to be the next best thing to sex.  I've got to get me another bottle...","I got this on sale and was not disappointed. Initially I thought it was boozy, then more flavorful, fun to drink as I got down past the neck of the bottle. Supposedly Jack Daniel barrels were used for this. There's no indication of that fungal JD sour mash. It's a perfected bourbon with a wonderful fragrance and a little sip of this stuff goes a long way for me.","Quite a lively young malt - fragrant","This is a sophisticated drop. As the packaging notes suggest the mouth is very soft, with subtle complexity on the palate and a pleasant yet slight smokey finish. Class all the way.","Deliciously fresh, very easy to drink, with incredibile citrussy notes:) Though I prefer sherry wood whiskies, I really enjoyed a bottle of this amazing dram:)","I am a newcomer in the kingdom of singlemalts but still it really impressed me. It is more interesting than eg. Macallan 10yo fine oak which was too dry","Perfectly pleasant and straightforward. Personally, I wouldn't pay ?27 for it, but it's a safe introduction to malts, the dram many will come to for the first time. Just remember to carry on moving through! I think the producers hired a poet for the TNs who had sampled the marketing speak, not the whisky.","Hello Mr Yuck.This whisky tastes nothing like Gin.You really are talking a lot of nonsense.It is highly perfumed,but where is the gin like bitterness,tell me?A blind tasting you say.Deaf and Dumb more like!","Sweet?  Are we drinking the same thing?  This tastes like gin.  The nose is too flowery for me.  I've conducted two blind tastings and no one liked this.","The whisky has definately changed along with the packaging.A little sweet for my liking,but still a good introduction to single malt.","Best of the big hitters for me. Such a distinctive flavour that develops in a linear fashion from the nose. Great. Smooth and subtle but with plenty of character.","Light and sweet malt that everyone should like. The 'orangie' packaging certainly stands out on the shelves, which is perhaps the point.","Both Gs are pronounced in Glenmorangie.  The last part is pronounced like 'orange-y'.","This is a fine single malt. I'm also not a big fan of the new bottle and the above Producer's Notes are simply ridiculous.","How do you pronounce this?  Slient G or not?","I think they want to do a Glennfiddich with their re-design. By not colouring the bottle, they've failed and made what looks, as 08 Jun says, like a Cognac.","I certainly would not complain about the taste of my favorite Malt Whisky, but I just have to set on record that I think the new packaging is ridiculous. This isn't Cognac , I have nothing against things French ( love Champagne ) , but this styling is just too French for me, and it pains me to look at it. One of the best Scotch Whiskies in the world should not be bottled to look like this ... What exactly are you trying to say Glenmorangie ?","I agree with the above  - an exercise in verbosity when all that needs to be said that this is a superb malt for anybody with a sweet tooth. And it isn't too bad for those without one.","Check out the hilariously OTT Producer's Tasting Notes!!  OMG, LOL, WTF?!?!They have got to be kidding, right?","u cant go wrong with this )"],"74":["\nThis is the first time I have had this whiskey.

Way to sweet in my opinion and the flavor is only a couple of steps away from the taste offering from Cutty Sark. Probably good to some but I'll pass.

Have with a dash of water for maximum enjoyment. It's not particularly exciting, but does whisky need to be exciting to be nice? No.  A decent dram.","Absolutely nothing wrong with this whiskey,very easy to get along with,and well worth the money.","I bought this speysider in 2010, when it was 43% in the green glass' bottle. It's truly enjoyable, with a lot baked apples are playing lead role on the nose with malty sweetness on palate. A slightly bitter aftertaste don't lowered the score. To get it more smooth it's highly recommended to drink this single malt some days (even months!) after the bottle first opening. Best try it neat in a cognac glass.","Such promise. \r\n\r\nOn the nose it really does talk a good game. It's spirited and punchy. Lively and both sharp and at the same time woody and relaxed. Before taking a sip I'm already deciding it's going to taste like something between aberlour 10 and JW Green. Unfortunately it's neither of them. JW Green I think is a great whisky for the price. It's a great yardstick in terms of what a scotch can be for the price. \r\n\r\nIt's not a bad scotch but it's rather outgunned by the competition. In the mouth it takes a few drams to get established on the palette. To begin with it's almost too light, too fleeting. A short finish. It's crisp but almost finishes on the swallow. A few drams in and it does build a little and there's slightly more going on but never enough for it to be more than something to drink to judge it against better drinks.","Beautifull whiskey","Excellent superb.","At this price point it was a fine drink.","It is going to taste light to some people simply because they like a more forceful whisky.  I do too at times however I like all sorts of spirits.  This is tasty and has its place in the drinks cabinet.  Good stuff at the right time.","What I love about this single malt is the full body.  It has a nice depth of malty flavour.  However, if it was 43% or, ideally, 46%, it would be an infinitely better single malt.  There's a lot more that this whisky can say but it's difficult to hear at 40%, which is disappointing.  However, it's a good value for money.","I really like this whisky. I was given it as a present. Never heard of it before. Drunk plenty of others. This has a really lovely fruity nose and depth to it. It's been a real pleasure to drink.","A very poor choice given the competition available. Tastes very similar to a fairly ordinary blended whisky with no real depth or pleasant finish","I can smell the peat, heather, haggis and hear the bagpipes in the background with every sip","Wonderful!  I love it! It's my after-hours treat to myself!","Absolutely perfect to the palette l love it","I love this whisky. It does not shout but it is business. Great value for the quality.","I am a peaty, smokey whisky fan:  Lagavulin 16 or Laphroaig 10 being favourites,  Thus when given a bottle of Strathisla 12 I was not expecting much joy:  But how wrong I was.  This is a wonderful, characterful whisky, with masses of flavour that can compete with the best.  Smooth, sweet & fruity, but with enough bite and malt to be fun.  Highly recommended.","I was treated to this one this Christmas. After opening and having my first glass, I quickly went straight back to the bottle and poured another. A very smooth, moreish drink. I got fudge on both the nose and palate.","On my first glass of a bottle. I like it. Im no expert, i think ''scotch fan'' comment below has this whisky summed up very well. Lovely nose, fruity taste, and a little oily on the aftertaste. It works, and the design definitely feels to me like they are taking some inspiration from the Japanese market, whish is no bad thing. Looking forward to rest of bottle :) not a going to make to make it onto the favorites list yet, but very enjoyable","A very pleasant malt that is well made and easy to drink. Great drinking and good quality.\nIts impossible not to enjoy.","It is a good smooth whiskey but the ending is very smokey and bitter but when I noticed it was mad by the shivas brothers I could feel chivas regal in it. So not as smooth as I had hoped but a nice dram anyway","Brilliant stuff,great for sharing with best drinking buddy,5 out of 5","It is a nice single malt to have on the rocks. Loved it and will buy again.","A very pleasant and enjoyable single malt. Now on my short list for future purchases.","Agree 100% with scotch fan, their old presentation was actually 43%, i'm guessing that was a better dram than this new one, although as you say it IS an elegant whiskey none the less, and well worth the money.","A sherried, fruity, soft and elegant dram with oaky undertones and medium length finish. Body is mostly round and oily. A very drinkable and pleasant Speysider, very approachable especially for those who are new-ish to the world of Single Malt Scotch. Great job with the new packaging, this hidden dram should get more attention this way. One cannot, however, help to think what if this was bottled at 43% without chill-filtration and coloring.","Welldone repackaging, always have loved the whisky but now it is having a great presentation!"],"75":["\nFirst proper bottle i bought for myself after trying a sample in my local store.

Easy drinking and one of my current favourites.","It\u2019s actually a great scotch for the value, it does have a brighter feel at 1st sip  but it\u2019s smooth and like any other fine single malt whiskies it has a bold but subtle finish. The guys that are giving low reviews just aren\u2019t scotch drinkers and probably mix theirs with cola or something bizzare as such. Cheers fellas!","Reading these reviews is a roller coaster ride.  This is fine for its price point.  Not going to rush to buy it again but it's not the vile beast many are making it out to be.","I have only tried Scotch a couple times in my life (I'm only 29 years old) and when I saw this for the price I figured I would give it another try, and I am happy that I did. I am now a huge fan of scotch and of Glenlivet \u2013 the taste is very smooth, there's a very slight sweetness to it and doesn't burn going down. My dad (he's 70 years old) loves Scotch and after he tried it he went out and bought two bottles for himself. I highly recommend this for anybody who is interested in trying Scotch or wants to add a great bottle to their collection.","Few flavors one after another in your mouth. Actually pretty good. I liked it although I love the smokey ones. This one is not smokey at all and still a pleasure.","Worst whiskey ever had. Picked up in duty free on a offer. Unable to finish.","Smooth, great tasting and a superb finish. One of my favorites and its price is definitely lower than the taste of this scotch.","I really liked the smoothness and flavor. It is a very good supper and I will buy it again.","My first single-malt scotch, picked precisely because it was the \"most affordable\" (i.e. cheapest) one on the shelf, and now my wife and I are both scotch drinkers because of it.  Really smooth, with a lovely scent of caramel (or toffee).  Love this stuff.","Better for mixing than \"scotch\".","Smooth and easy to drink; Great value.","Delicate and light. Definitely not for everyone but it goes down very very easily. Not awfully scotch-y though. I personally really like it.","Not even going to finish the bottle. I'll let the Mrs mix it with Pepsi.\nThere are much much better malt and blended whiskies at the price.","The Glenlivet 12 year old has always been one of my favourite whiskies  and I thought the 'Founder's Reserve' would be a variant of this much-loved malt. How wrong I was  - tasteless with no redeeming features whatsoever. To be fair, I've not enjoyed any NAS malts from any other brand leaders so Glenlivet aren't alone. From now on I'll pay the extra or just stick with US or Irish whiskey.","The bottle came in a gift box with a Glenlivet glass. The glass is nice.","Lovely malt for a decent price, fantastic for those long summer evenings ahead","Reading the reviews, people seem to love this or hate it.   It\u2019s really a matter of what your looking for.  I like variety.  This is a great addition to my cabinet.  It is mild, no smoke and no bite.  It\u2019s best with a solitaire  (spring or distilled)  ice cube.  Flavor is good - malty and a little sweet.  Good spring or summer scotch.  It\u2019s not a mixer (like sewers or J&B) as some of the negative reviews say.  Great scotch for the price.","Taste is unique to every individual and it's impossible for any \"expert\" to hold forth on Scotch for the benefit of anyone else. If you enjoy a Scotch, then drink it. It's useless to advise anyone else when the taste of anyone else is unique to them only. I enjoy Glenlivet you may feel differently.","This is the most mundane, boring, uneventful single malt I've ever tasted. Bought on impulse without reading any reviews. Mistake. I, like many before me, was enticed by the \"Founders Reserve\" claim. This is scotch flavored water. No scratch that...this fat free scotch flavored water. Don't buy this.","Not the best scotch I've ever tried, but definitely not the worst.  Probably won't end up being my go-to but it isn't as bad as some of the people here say.","Boring... no depth or character. Watery. Way overpriced! Done with Glenlivet... untrustworthy... no more of my money.","I\u2019ve been a big fan of the 12 and 18 year old scotch. Tried this recently and not a fan. I find it harsh and maybe better on the rocks. I understand that the demand for the 12 year old is forcing the NSA marketing play. But this isn\u2019t it. If you\u2019re going NSA go with a 12 year blended like Chivas.","Far from being a whisky snob, I am a complete whisky newbie. Glenlivet's Founder's Reserve is only my sixth bottle of whisky to date. I bought it on offer, attracted by the price tag and Glenlivet's reputation. When I got home I Googled to see the reviews, and found the ones here. I decided I should return the bottle, but when my previous bottle of Jura Superstition (a very accessible, enjoyable whisky for a newcomer) ran out, I figured 'I'm no whisky snob, I should still enjoy this!'.\n\nBoy was I wrong. It's incredibly linear, and the nose gives away everything you need to know. This tastes like a poor bourbon - only worthy of being used with a mixer. And I think that's exactly what I'll do: offer it up to guests who enjoy their 'whisky' with a coke, as I can't see me finishing this bottle on the rocks. Easily the worst of the whiskies I've tried to date and I wouldn't ouch this again.","Very sweet easy going whisky, kick back, relax  & enjoy, don't over think, just relish it.","Marginally better than the Johnnie Walker blends at the same price point ... and that's not saying much. \n\nSmooth enough but too sweet for my tastes. Zero oak. Just doesn't seem like a serious single malt to me at all. Personally, I prefer single malts from the island and highland regions that belt you with more complex notes along with oak and peat.  Save a little and go for Laphroiag Quarter Cask or a Talisker 10. The latter two are night and day better than the entry level Speysides like Glenlivetsor Glenfiddich.","Lacks complexity. Disappointing.","As a life long fan of Glenlivet, this is a shockingly bad product. For me it was  almost undrinkable. Just my opinion.","This really is a marketing ploy. I'm not a major fan of the 12 year old but, if gifted I'll be happy to indulge. However the founders reserve is offensive. Little more than coloured alcohol, a little flavour but nothing discernable. Water helps a little but you have to drown it to make it drinkable. George Smith must burl in his grave. An appalling offering. If you get it as a gift pass it quickly. Certainly don't waste money on this insult.","Never tasted a nicer single malt, very easy going down, zesty and fruity love it but dangerous, could drink it like cordial, no harshness at all love it","Magic.....","A great introduction to single malt whiskey. A hint of citrus and smooth. Not bad for the price.","Smooth and peppery finish with the cask notes to the fore in the taste compared to the nose which was rather bland with only a hint of the grass and toffee as described. A reasonable but not exceptional whisky and not deserving of the bad reviews.","I had this bought for me for Christmas and love it. It smooth and is very easy to drink.","Weak. Tastes watered down, with little body, less flavor. \nNot smooth, as you would expect from this usually exceptional distiller! Disappointing, at best! Could be referred to as swill! If this was not a gift, I would return it. I refuse to drink rotgut, so will save this for those I do not like!","My wife gets me a bottle of good whisky every Christmas.  For the last two years it has been Founder's Reserve. My brother also brought me a bottle on his visit from Canada.   Overall it is excellent.  I can't tell you about nose, palate etc, all I know is that I like it.  very smooth and mellow.  Tastes great!","Disappointed.  Prefer your 12 yr","Very good nose, with lots of citrus, even a hint of chocolate.  Taste suprises with fruits and even some coffee. A delicate and complex whisky.","Being fairly new to Scotch, I find myself picking up cheaper nightly sippers as I explore what I know damn well are superior drams here and there.  A bottle of Glenlivet Founder's Reserve is about on par with Finlaggan, my other nightly sipper, both in price and quality.  I prefer something peatier than Glenlivet (e.g. Finlaggan), but the Glenlivet's decent and at least as good as my Glenfiddich 12.  Overall I am set on single-malt Scotch, and preferably an Islay; no Bourbon, no Whiskey, and no blends for me.  Insofar as that goes, I have no problem winding down with a few ounces of Glenlivet FR and would give a more expensive Glenlivet a go as well.","Fantastic nose; pears, even a bit of dark chocolate.  Taste again surprisingly good for NAS.  However bit pepperery or rough on finish.  Nice whisky","I loved the 12yo. The Founders Reserve is bland and cheap with a shallow flavour.  Not for me.","I don't know what all the bad reviews are about. Sure it is young, but it ticks the boxes. Trouble is there is too much choice and too much wealth.","average entry range scotch. I love the 12yo to which this is no comparison.  To add to that not too many years ago you could pick up a bottle of 12yo for less than this.","As a long time scotch drinker  this one is not worth my time    a big step backwards   for glenlivit","Had high hopes for something called founders reserve, but no age statement and lower price should have clued me in.  Not up to par.","Best malt I have tasted\nAbsolutely wonderful","If you want someone to hate whisky give them this juice. Absolutly horrid. Smooth they say?  It is harsh on the nose and the palate. For me in the same league with cheap blends.","I was dissapointed when they gave me this instead of the 12yo in my bar but after tasting it i cannot complain at all. The nosing is very pleasant ferom afar. Fresh apples and pears are screaming out of the glass. I serve it now with cubes of fresly cut apple. Tastes worse than the 12yo but can sell and people love it when you make a small introduction. #bartenderlyfe","Very low end single!  Drinkable but not by much. The G12 is so much better. I got this stuff on sale at Costco and will only serve it to my buddies after they are well-toasted on GOOD single malts and cannot taste the difference. Save your money and buy at least 12 year singles.  If not dated, don't waste your $$.","Very smooth. Very enjoyable. Easy to drink","Had a large sample hi en to me today. Tried it. Poor. Very poor. The best part was maybe the nose ? Close your eyes and it's like sniffing an empty glass of Merlot. The compliments stop there. At 40% it's as weak as a kitten. Supermarket whisky.","Kind of candied-fruity for my taste, but enjoyable. Would be a nice, gentle introduction to scotch for someone who is put off by the heavier smoke and peat of some other choices.\n\nThe price is right, too.","I was given this as a gift. I think it represents good value. My usual preference is for the ones with a smoky peat flavour,but i found this to be a very pleasant drop with a lovely smoooth finish.","I considered myself not a fan of scotch. This one has changed my mind. Extremely smooth, very clean finish. I had just read a book on whisky\/whiskey and decided to buy a bottle. Very glad I did. Looking forward to trying other ages.","I'm glad it was on sale, because I cannot imagine paying full price for this \"watered-down\" scotch.  Zero body and zero flavor.","Complex but no depth. Sweet but easily diluted.","Disappointing -- minimal body and richness. Pass.","Poor. Lacks any depth or subtlety and quite a harsh and crude aftertaste.\n\nA disappointing replacement for what was one of the better 12 year olds.","Easy on the palate, with a great finish","wonderfully smooth","Good for a second drink after a 15 or 18 year.","This is first time I tried Glenlivet but I was having a vanilla icecream after dinner and poured a glass,what a perfect companion...I would defintely class it as a summer whisky perfect with icecream,next time I will add strawberries","Great tasting and easy to drink.","Well balanced and reasonable complexity for the price point. Pears, grass and toffee most prominent. Very easy to enjoy.","A very good scotch, considering the price point.  There is plenty of flavour and a very smooth finish.","As a fan of the more smokier Islay whisky, I seldom purchase other single malt Scotch Whisky, except for some Highland.  I've never been a fan of Speyside whisky but Glenlivet Founder's Reserve has changed this. I've not got the comparison of the 12 or 18 year old, but this is a very good whisky. Having read the reviews already, I understand the point of the lack of character. There's not a lot going on with this whisky. What is going on though is an exceptionally smooth finish. This is very easy to drink and it is fresh yet fruity. I will call this my chardonnay of whisky's.  Also the price is good. If you are not in a speciality whisky shop and you're looking for a solid dram and afraid of picking up something which tastes terrible, always buy this! I've been delightedly surprised. I can't wait to drink the 18 year old now!","I really liked the 12, this is not half as good.  \nTaste was a bit sharp and (as someone else points out), sort of soapy.","As advertised _light and smooth, very smooth!?? Nice difference from my favorite 18 year old.","Clean. No depth of character whatsoever.  My first ever Glenlivet coming peaty bruisers, very disappointed. Not looking to buy another.","If you can get this cheap enough then I think it's a decent 'everyday' dram.","Disappointed..I was in the mood for scotch, more like a blended Canadian wiskey. At least it came as a mini in my gift box of 12 year or I would be wholly disappointed. Will not buy sorry.**1\/2","Never had a Glenlivet before, but I'll be trying some others.  A very nice introduction to their range, and to me,  a little reminiscent to a Glenkinchie a had a while ago, but with a deeper colour perhaps.  Thoroughly enjoyable as far as I'm concerned,  and not overly sweet.","Everything is fine except for a weird note when nosing and a strange aftertaste that I can only get rid of when mixing with other Scotches. Sad display from Glelivet. Even a Tullamore Dew or Regular Jamison has more character. 3 stars only because it's the holidays!","Picked a bottle of this up today on offer, first tried this whisky last Christmas and thought it wasn't too bad for a no age statement Whisky, There's nothing complex going on here, it's a light, smooth and sweet whisky with floral notes which suit my taste.  A decent whisky for the price I paid but wouldn't pay full price.  Not sure why Glenlivet chose to substitute the superior 12 year old for this.","I am enjoying my first tastes of this Scotch. I knew when I bought it that it wasn't the same as the 18 year old Glenlevit I know and love. After reading mixed responses from very good to dissapointed I had to try it. I don't drink a lot but I love a quality drink from time to time. As for me I am proud to display this right next to it's pricer relative. It's a smooth drinkable single malt with no terrible after affects. I definitely will purchase it again and probably again. For those of you who don't enjoy this I hope you don't view my commentary as misleading. Each palette is different and nobody can account for another's taste but for me I enjoy it.","some think french are ruining scotch of remarkable brand but to me it is OK not at all 18 yrs. but to me separable, if my wife likes it that means it is fine, light your Robusto cigar and have a little chocolate with it","Weak compared to the 12 yr, and only picked it up in a pinch.  As others have noted the price point isn't justified compared to the 12.  I like the 15yr French Oak, but won't be buying the founders again.  I'll drink a bourbon before that one.","Wonderful smooth drink. Super creamy with lots of orange flavors.  For the price a super whisky and  comparable to higher end and priced whisky.","It is a single malt, contrary to what some peoples reviews have been saying. I like it, its a clean flavor and a good tipple for Christmas.","Not a fan which is unfortunate. Love the standard 12, 15 & 18.  This one sadly I'll never buy again as it's not enjoyable; at least for me.  Rather have 12 yrs Dewars versus this one","Blended from various years and styles, and thus quite inferior to the classic 12 yr. old single malt. An wholly unwelcome departure from a great tradition.","Not a patch on the 12 year old. Sadly I'll not by this again and would be sorted for the future quality of the brand as a whole.","Smooth, light refreshing flavour. Add a drop of soda to sparkle. Love it.","Easy to drink but a little uninspiring, nice fruity notes but a little sweet","Clean but lacks. It's tasty but there's no depth. Nice drink.","Very disappointed.  Not a patch on the normal 12 yr old. Holds the Glenlivet flavour but there is a sharpness that indicates it is blended with younger batches.","What a disappointment. Yet another malt changes hands and is cheapened. Completely inferior to the standard Smiths' Glenlivet 12 yr old which seems to be no longer available. Disgusted by the French ruining what I used to consider THE standard malt. I've bought my last and may also stop buying Ricard as a result.","very fruity well balanced easy drinking whiskey!","I love the 12 year old and was hesitant to try this one what with it being NAS.. However it's great in its own right. Very fresh, bold fruit, yet soft and with a gentle finish. More than passable for an everyday dram.","At first I was disappointed. It tasted like there wasn't enough character in the drop to give it a distinct taste. Then I added a few drops of water and bang! The hidden sweetness becomes unlocked and the spread of flavours becomes distinct. Very enjoyable to drink, infact I'm having my third glass right now.","It is good","It is ok....that is all that can be said about it. \nNowhere near the quality of the 12yo, almost the same price. Similar price to Jameson, but not even close to as nice. Why would I bother? Won't be buying again","Lovely","Very poor replacement for the great 12 year old. I have told my wife to start getting me Glenfiddich. Never thought I would see the day.","A good single malt for the price. I prefer the French oak reserve.","Introduced to me in 2015 and I was totally sold on single malt Scotch whiskey.  Could never acquire the taste of JW, Dewer's, or others.  Thank you Chris Soape and Glenlivet.","Bold clean taste up front with a pleasant vapor followup. A soft finish and no after burn. Excellent for fireside sipping on a cold day.","Slightly fruitier than other Taliskers - reminded me of a port cask finish.  Very pleasant, especially as it was on offer and cost no more than the supermarket own brand single malt.  I'm no expert, but I liked it and would buy it again.","Not superior to 12yrs glenlivet, relatively bitter and more woody to taste, may be its not aged even for 12years,  In my opinion 12yr is better product","Loved it.","Only ok. No age quoted so I'm suspicious. Won't pay the full price as I got this bottle at discount.\nWill continue to experiment.","The aroma of the fair as the glass nears your mouth followed by a lovely smooth delivery with a spicy hint makes this one of my new favourites in the smooth range","A disappointment and certainly worse than the lovely 12 year old that it is destined to replace.","Not a bad whiskey, but not comparable to the 12 year old product.  Is it worth the same as a 12 year old Glenlivit?  Not in my book, no matter what the marketing gurus would have you believe, age makes a difference with single malts.  If you can't put an age on a bottle you can't charge the same price as one with an age on it.  This product does not show the same character as the one it would like to replace.","The perfect easy drinking single malt for nights when you have no intention of replacing the cork. My new go to in its cork tossing price range.","Many short five star reviews. One should take them with a large pinch of salt.\nOK so the 12 was never the world''s greatest malt, but it was consistent, well made and readily available. This really comes across as a step back for me. There is a shortness of finish, the nose isn''t as deep. Overall this will sell, particularly to the younger generation of whisky drinkers,  but at a cost to older fans who will probably turn more to glenfiddich etc.  \nIn my opinion","Tasty, smooth and more-ish.","Light with fruity apple taste and perfectly nice albeit not as good as the 12 year old. Bottle purchased on offer, would be unlikely to purchase at full price.","Smooth! Fruity, gorgeous, an instant favourite.","Nice! Fruity and sweet,  much better than 12 yo","Very poor, a huge disappointment and a thoroughly inadequate replacement for the 12yo. Weird, sour, soapy flavour and a complete lack of depth. The price just adds insult to injury, very difficult to see how this can be sustained.","An inoffensive no age statements probably ideal for those new to whisky. In this light it is miles better than some of it''s rivals, especially the one in a blue bottle. However it is a too bland for me and lacking in depth. I really like the 12 year old and window stick to that in future.","Braw ! Warm ! Smooth and sweet.","Surprised to find similar nose and character of the 12 but muted somehow.\nThe glenlivet is a highly productive distillery so the move towards a non aged product is odd.","Nice, I sense a lot of fruity flavors gives a lingering heat effect but comes down nice. Not your 15 yr old but we''ll worth its price.","Poor at the RRP. Young, sweet, estery, no complexity, a qualitative step down from the 12 in every way. Chivas gave us the ''Age Matters'' slogan, this is a sad bellwether of where the industry is headed.","Decent whisky, lots of apple and toffee on the nose, soft fruity flavor, apple lingering. Not bad at all.","Far behind the 12yo.Very disappointing.","Disappointed. This is very different to the 12yo. It would be fine if it was supposed to be sold alongside the established sibling but as a replacement it fall very short.  The fact that it is being trialled in the UK and Germany first is also a bit of an insult.","Perfect"],"79":["\nNice and smokey and with a sweet finish.

Some other reviews led me to believe I would be getting a peaty speysider, this is not the case IMO. Develops into a fudgey fruity malty dram, very smooth and easy going down. Would not hesitate in buying this again. I also believe this to be Non Chill Filtered and no e150. Natural goodness","Another great young Speysider from the distillery of Benromach. Vibrant nose with grass, citrus, and some peat. Same expressions continue to persist on the mouth; however, there is mineral and some sweetness involved this time. Long, smoky finish, which is decidedly very pleasant. Quite approachable and easy-drinking peated Speyside, a great entry-level Single Malt Scotch with a distinct character.","Super smooth with a lovely balance and warmth. A little smoke on the finish too. Well worth a try at this offer price.","I tried a tipple at the Scotland Boat show in Kip Marina and was blown away by the superb taste of the 10 year old.

I'm going to the shop in Forres next time I'm passing to buy a bottle.","I remember 2002 walking through barley fields in Roseile (nr Benromach - Forres) Now drinking the fields bounty is romantic but more striking is the quality of this malt, its nose is malt, leather - black polish ? Taste gives Oak, cinnamon, spirited vanilla, ending with a freshly lit cigar. Finish - Long smoke, dry, raisins.  Really impressed and suprised with this expression. Touch of peat in the spey region is interesting.","Very Peaty not what you would expect from a Spey.","id rather spend an extra tenner and get 18year old fiddich","I don't usually but whiskies less than 46% these days, but I made an exception with this as it's absolutely superb","I didn't excpet so much peatsmoke from this whisky, but it combines very well with the sweet Speyside-feeling.

I'm usually a Dewars blend guy, but this stuff is so familiar.  No ice, just a splash of water.  Thanks, John!","Bought the 12 yr on sale - first try.  Very drinkable with a bit of water. Warm Spice on the nose, reminds one of Halloween.  A biit peppery on the toungue, with hint of fruit, but not too sweet. Finish is dry but stays on the top of the palette.  I normally like the peaty whiskies, and more complex Highlands, but for the price of $30 this is fantastic stuff.","Excellent product. Tastes as good or better than most higher priced scotch whiskeys.","It's gross, if there was a zero stars i would give it a negative","Amazing...","Delicious!","Bought on a whim. Pretty tasty. Added a bit of water. Tastes decidedly fruity, oaky, and actually quite a bit like... tea? Interesting and drinkable. I may have added a bit too much water to my glass, as it tastes a bit watered down (IMAGINE THAT!?), but I know for next time. This is a very tasty, reasonably priced scotch.","Its like you are drinking warm honey who was set on fire. Not burning or sharp, but as smooth as malt syrup.\nI must admit I dont like Whisky until someone recomandet this brand.","I borderline love this. It came highly recommended. First impression was rich and smooth with a light spice. It is definitely on my list of good ones but not sure if its a favorite. I give it 4 stars for its appeal.","The nose is bright, with fresh apple as well as a distinct apple cider note. The palate is slightly richer than the nose, with light wood notes integrated nicely with honey, faint beeswax, and light spice. It's a fairly short and somewhat thin finish. It's not the most complicated single malt and for me, drinks more like a blended whisky - that's not a criticism, just an observation. It's pretty good. Great summertime whisky. I would be interested in trying the 21.","I'm more a bourbon drinker but I try to get to know scotch, I picked a bottle of this one on sales and it wasn't what I expected. It's really fruity on the nose and the taste was really clean, kind of refreshing. It almost felt line I was drinking cider. It's not what I was expecting from a whisky, but I was pleasantly surprised and I feel like it would be the best introduction to whisky for my friends who feel like whisky is too harsh and strong.","Very drinkable. Perfect, long lasting finish with honey and fruity notes.","Just had a bottle bought for me for my birthday. It is now my favourite single malt, used to be Balvenie doublewood. This is a lovely easy to drink whisky that I will definitely buy, and enjoy again and again.","Nice \"everyday\" whiskey! Very short finish tho.","Clean,crisp and smooth.Lovely surprise","Not bad for a Scotch. The pro is that Aberfeldy doesn't taste as overpowering as many other Scotch brands. The con is that it doesn't have a whole lot of other flavours to make up for it. A good way to describe Aberfeldy is that the way a light beer tastes in comparison to its regular version, Aberfeldy tastes a bit like a light scotch. All the normal flavours you'd expect are there but they come off fairly toned down.","I will buy this one again.  Has a good burn to it with a taste mainly of the Oak cask.  Not a complicated whisky and I would disagree with the comments that state this is a smooth whisky.  However, this is an easy whisky to refil your glass to, again and again and again, well, you get the picture right?","Wow more than I expected for under $50 you can't go wrong mellow & sweet","This is one of those \"blank slate\" whiskies. No sherry, no peat. As a guy who tends to go for sherry and peat I forget about these. This is a really good whisky and I think it's relatively complex for something so \"plain\".  On the nose I get honey and nutty barley mixed with something sweet like fruit.  On the palate a nice nutmeg-like spice mixes in. The finish is surprisingly long and warming, with a bitter orange or lemon peel note that mixes in perfect balance. My only complaint is that this is only 40% abv. Very good stuff. Although I'm sure Dewars is greatly improved by the presence of Aberfeldy, in my opinion this stuff is best served neat and on its own","This whisky is near the top of my list for value. An excellent dram with a beautiful finish.","Better than Glenlivet 12 in my opinion but not as good as Macallan 12. Still a newby but side by side tasting tonight.","First time buying and I will definitely buy again.  New to single malts but if I find more like this I will be happy.","Lovely, mild on the tongue with a slight burn at the end.

It's sweet and easy drinking with a medicinal aftertaste. The nose is diverse enough to allow other scents in along with the peat.

Stop wasting people's time that are looking for useful comments, perhaps you should stick to your Glenfiddich IPA","This is the easy drinkers delight, sweet but with enough complexity and smokiness to keep one interested from the first sip until the last, an absolute gem in my opinion. Great whiskey and an asset to any collection.","A fantastic Scotch. Not too strong, not too light. The smokiness compliments it instead of dominating it.","Do you enjoy the smell of a forest fire?  Ever wondered what it'd taste like in liquid form?  Well, here you go.  Alternatively, if you'd like to save a few bucks, buy yourself a bottle of Liquid Smoke then mix it in with some cheap scotch.  To be fair, Glenfiddich India Pale Ale is my usual go-to but thought to venture out for once.  I just didn't realize that venturing out would mean I'd find myself in the middle of a California wildfire with a thick layer of soot coating my tongue and cheeks.","Seaspray, fresh fruit, heather, bon fire smoke that does not dominate this well balanced dram !!!","As others have noted, the Bowmore 12 is ridiculously easy to drink, especially compared to the infinitely more peaty Islays from Laphroaig, Ardbeg and even Lagavulin. That's good and bad. Sometimes I don't want to lick a burned down house. Sometimes I want a mellower Islay. Trouble is, you can get deep into a bottle of this without realizing it until you're quite tipsy.  I like it. My collection mainly consists of smoke monsters such as Laphroaig Quarter Cask and Ardbeg Corryvracken, but I'll keep Bowmore 12 around, too.","a beautiful easy drinking whisky. sweet and slightly peaty.","on the eye: caramel caramel caramel. not a bad malt, but not that great either, delicate and fragile, does not hold any water. bowmore 12 has the potential to be a real bang for the buck only of the distillers grow some sense and stop colouring and chill filtering their product. sometimes i wonder when i sip this dram if im actually tasting the e150a. this whisky has been heavily coloured, and to top it, its bottled at 40%. guess the distillers have done everything right to make this a mediocre product. the only good thing about the bowmore distillery, in my opinion is that they do their own malting, which is fantastic but sadly the distillery has failed to capitalize on it and have delivered an amateur engineered product.","Ok scotch, I had better ones.","An extremely smooth scotch with a nice smokey taste.","Good easy going peaty tasting","The only single malt I didn't like so far. Dry and smoked to the bone...I couldn't really taste anything else than smoke. Cannot be compared to Laphroig or Ardbeg,  which are truly great whiskies. Won't buy or try it again.","I'm no fan of overly peaty whisky, while this has the nose (and some aftertaste) of a peat it's more smoky with a rich sweetness on the tongue. Tried with water\/ice but much preferred the rich neat flavour.","Amazing perfect peat if you don't want or like the  \"tcp\" heavy peat type whiskys :) it's great value","superb, its great balance and lighter peat compared to a lot of islay","I got this as a Christmas gift and was amazed when I tried it.  It's, without a doubt, the best Scotch I've ever had.","My favourite malt of all time, so good","Really nice balance of sweet and smokey, personally think i prefer it to bunnahabhain 13 and caol ila 12 if that helps.","The nose is quite nice, somewhere between hardwood smoke and damp Florida topsoil. None of that reaches the tongue, save for the faint taste of soot.  Mild finish, with a little bit of salt. Probably not something I'd buy again, but not something I'd try to dissuade someone else from trying a dram of.","This is an excellent Islay malt. Perfect balance of salty and sweet. It would be easy to dismiss this as Laphroaig light but there is a lot more going on. Very fruity with heather honey to balance out the peat smoke. Slight brine with some oily texture. Very nice. I like variety in my whisky so I always have a few different bottles open at a time. While nothing will ever replace Laphroaig as my favorite peated whisky this is a great change of pace","Don't know what the fuss is about. Hardly any kick. Finished the bottle in one evening with friends. \nIts too easy drinking  for me.   Maybe the sweetness blocks the smoke I don't know but there was no direction really and i paid a lot of money for that","Solid Islay malt. Bowmore 12 has more in common with Laphroaig rather than Ardbeg or Lagavulin in terms of flavour. Lighter than Laphroaig (obviously, as just about everything is), it still possesses a rich smoky, peaty flavour and a pleasantly oily mouthfeel. If Laphroaig terrifies you, give Bowmore a try.","Used to drink this a lot in my local pub, became one of my favorite whiskeys and it will always bring good memories whenever I have a glass","I really liked it. First thing that came to mind was the honey and peat. Beautiful amber color. Furthermore it had a long intense finish.","One of my all time favourite malts is the Bowmore 15 y.o. , but this 12 y.o. is very close. Great value for such a great whisky. Mellow and warming. Lovely stuff!","Brilliant spirit!  And that tumbler is perfect for drinking, I've had one since 1987 when you would get two with a bottle of 12 YO!  If only they'd bring the dumpy brown bottle back!","This is very well made whisky. If you have tried an Islay whisky and have been put of with the strong peat flavour, this could be for you. It is smoky and I like it very much.","I once saw someone drinking this. I believe they enjoyed it.","Excellent whisky, at a reasonable price and very drinkable. Truly outstanding Islay single malt.","The First glass I took I was negatively surprised by the strong smell of peat smoke. But after a while I fell in love with this Whisky. Very very long finish. Sweet 'n salty. Perfect balance. Indeed add a,little water, leave it alone for 10 minutes. Then take the glass and put your nose in it. You will dream away. What a nice nose this one has.","A very nice Islay dram. Lots of freshness and I get salt and mint too. Just a tad smoother than the standard NAS bottling but other than that, they're pretty similar.","This is a great medium-peaty whisky.  Not as over powering as the Darkest 15 or the Tempest 10 Batch 2 or 3.  If you like a mild strength and mildly peaty dram then certainly try this one out, it's an all rounder and priced pretty nicely compared to the stronger Bowmore whisky's.  If you're looking for something to hit the heart and every organ strength wise then this isn't it, try a Darkest 15 or Tempest.","Bowmore is the only one if you like smoky, but not necessarily industrial strength peat overpowering all other flavors.  There is a definite snobbishness when it comes to \"peat monsters\", I find.  The Bowmore range to me is  a progression, with maximum smokiness at 15 years, then dwindling to delightful floral flavors.  My personal favorite is the 17 which I can only get at Duty Free.  It should be considered the \"delicacy\" of malts.","One of the best ways I've heard to drink Bowmore is to have a sip, then add a little water, which will release a \"salty\" character that supposedly comes from the distillery lying so close to the sea that this taste infuses with the whisky...","A very enjoyable Islay single malt that doesn't quite yet live to its full potential. Wonderful smell and easy to drink; Bowmore 12yo has a mixture of sweet and smoky notes but is still a bit unrefined and \"shy\" in taste. The finish in particular is rather undeveloped at this young age. A good introduction to Bowmore and Islay in general, but there are much better ones out there. 7 out of 10","This is much better than Bowmore 15 y darkest, but I can't recommend both of them. Simply too light and sweet for Islay malts. On the other hand, some people may like it that way.","You are supposed to add water very gradually.  If you find the character displayed sufficient off the get go, and there aren't any over powering flavor sensations nor alcohol content, then you may find 'neat' agreeable.  Otherwise add in accordance to your senses.","As far as that above comments go, DONT drink malts like this \"neat\" especially Islay's As far as i understand its the water that actually puts the whisky under duress, it  \"shocks\" it and brings out a lot of the more subtle flavours, so when you drink it \"neat\" you are basically missing out on a lot of what the distiller wanted you to experience !!!","Agree with the first review, do not overwater, maximum should be another 15% by volume.Use a dropper !!!","An Excellent lower priced Islay scotch to pour between tugs at the higher end bottles (Lagxxxx, etc). This one has a wonderful first impression, but lacks some of the finish the big boys provide. Still, I always have a bottle of this on hand. For me, it's easier to drink then the Lap quarter cask, Ardbeg 10,  or Laddie Peat. As posted above, this is a \"Neat\" dram.","A truly outstanding dram. Love the peat smoke, so rich and smooth. This has to be drunk neat.","Bought a bottle of this just to try something new. I never really went for the Islay whiskies before. Must say I love this one. The burst of smoke is something to savor every time. Personally I go one part whisky to one part water. Works perfectly with this gem. Open fire on a cold winters night, look no further.","Brilliant,lots of peaty smoke with a whiff of the sea in the background and finishes with a hint of sherry.Much smokier than the 10 year old,so smooth you could scoll it from the bottle.","The first single malt that I truly fell for. That woosh of smoke gets me every time. Very well balanced and integrated with a laid back and long finish to savour.","Avoid over-watering to access the numerous veils of peaty flavours available. A great malt for after dinner - so rich and muscley. The balance of Bowmore..."],"96":["\nFor the price, really smooth and drinkable whiskey. Nice colour, sweet caramel notes, mature finish.

It lacks the character and excitement of the Signature or say, the Macallan 10yo, but its mellowness and rounded flavour makes it easy to drink and enjoy, and before you know it, the bottle is empty","One of my first Whiskies, lovely drink, a sweet, moreish nuttyness on the front of the pallet, changing into intense spice at the back, with a warming, smooth and long finish.","Exceptional for the price, smoooooth, sweeet and longggg,","Absolutely my favourite single malt yet. Very strong sherry taste, lovely sweet background to it. So far i have been changing brand after every bottle to get a taste of the different malts available, but this is one where the bottle is definitely being bought again.

I miss the rich taste that some of 12yo have, like Laphroaig. But it's worth the price.\n","\nA delightful Speyside scotch. One of my favorites.\n","\nVery nice. Similar to The Balvanie. 5\n","\nBest whiskey I've ever had. So smooth and malty!\n","\nFirst time I have bought it and a great alternative to the Fiddich 12 - a sweet barley\/cereal and honeyed essence on the nose, sweet yet spicy on the palate; quite lovely as an entry-level and affordable age statement single malt - hits above its price point ($66 cdn in toronto); faint whisper of smoke which adds to the overall aromatic presence; a great dram.\n","\nVery good!\n","\nI am not a Whisky expert. I only started tasting Scotch two years ago on a trip to Scotland. I ordered the Classic Malts Strong with Lagavulin 16, Talisker 10 and Cragganmore 12. The Cragganmore was smoother and not as strong as the other two. During our trip this year, we visited the Cragganmore Distillery. I ordered the Cragganmore 12 and have tried it neat and in Old Fashioned and Rob Roy cocktails. I have enjoyed it and will purchase it in the future.\n","\nThis is a nice Speyside with a pleasant bready malt character. Has sandalwood on the nose along with the warm fruity scent, didn't really notice much smoke. The maltiness lingers for awhile, with a bit of medicinal aftertaste. While this was enjoyable, can't say I'd rather have this over something more strong and complex like Craigillache, or my Speyside gold standard, Balvenie 12. Was definitely worth a try.\n","\nOne of the best malt whiskies as its easy drinking ..smooth but not bland\n","\nLike most of the previous reviewers I had only learned about this lovely Speyside Scotch via various review sites. Much like Mr. LOKNES I was disappointed to find that it was only at select locations in Ontario and has been \"out of stock for the past several weeks. I did luck into a bottle at duty free at Fort Erie crossing into the US. - as soon as I tried this Scotch I knew I had another fav. for the liquor cabinet. I know others wont necessarily agree but I find it reminds me abit of another of my fav.'s - Dalwhinnie 15 year old but at a much better price point. I agree with other reviewers that I personally think this scotch could please a novice scotch drinker but also a more avid fan of Speyside Scotch. As a PS for Mr. LOKNES - you can order this scotch directly through the LCBO in Ontario and have it deleivered at no charge to your local outlet or for a small charge (I think $6.00 ) it can be sent to your home directly - Cheers\n","\nA sweet malty perfect delight.

This is one for the true connoisseur of aged single malts.  The warm flavours of slightly smoked wood and sweet Honey, linger on your taste buds with a lasting afterglow.  Absolutely wonderful , with an appealing aroma.","I bought a small bottle of this as a taster when in Scotland as there were so many to choose from. It is smooth and slightly honeyed with an amazing array of complex flavours. I'm hooked. I never tried any of the others I loved this one so much.","I rate this malt better than others that cost over three times as much! Have done a blind taste test with this and several other quality single malts and cragganmore won by miles. Highly recommended for those with a sensitive palate. You might be able to get better, but you'll struggle at this end of the market. A excellent addition to any collection.","There is no sherried maturation here. According to the maker it is 100% bourbon first refill. Actually IMHO it would be a better dram with some sherry influence as I find it somewhat austere as it stands.I agree that bumping up the ABV would make it more insteresting but this is not a Diageo trait. It's better on the nose than to drink, but I don't know anyone who just smells their whisky.","A pleasant but unambitious Speyside.  I've just finishing working my way through a bottle, a five month journey.  I agree with Mr Venables, it does grow on you, but it's an old faithful friend rather than an exciting new acquaintance .","My favorite of all of them, and I have tried many!!  A small drop of water to open it up, and it's dangerously delicious.","Was expecting big things from this one after a recomendation by a friend. I wouldn't go as far as to say I'm disapointed, but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. I doubt many people will agree with my next statement, but it reminds me a little of woodford reserve bourbon, which I was not expecting.","A bit dull. This is very much like a standard speysider with all those  Speyside qualities in the same bottle, but nothing memorable.","i had cragganmore last year... i had never tasted anything like this b4.. man o man... still dying for a bottle ..guys the production is lessened these dayzz???? was not able to find it in london.","Had Cragganmore for the first time weekend of 21st May, Man ooh man, this is the mother of all malts. never again shall i go for bourbon.","Quite pleasant malt, but should be bottled at higher strength.","The nose is a bit disappointing, palate is much more satysfying. Finish would be OK if not for a bit too strong a burn sensation. For me it is 83\/100.From this price range take Oban 14yo or Talisker 10yo.","just got this delivered to my door today , as it being my first time purchasing from this company , i was a little nervous , but all went smoothly , shall be back to buy more , well done to all staff at the whisky exchange","Fantastic stuff and very much underrated.","Never tried this until I saw it in the bar at the union station in downtown los angeles of all places.

Glenrothes, Benriach, Glenlivet, Aberfeldy do this style better.","This is the core malt for Johnnie Walker Black Label and is a favourite in Spain on account of its sweetness and easy gentle style.

Chewy, fruity, mild smokey notes, but nothing extensive. I found it overly lacking in character, but not terrible. Just not my palate. I would pick the 12, 15 and 18 over this one. 2\/5 for me.\n","\nOne of my favourites, plenty to interest the pallet and can be picked up for a more than reasonable price.\n","\nGreat entry level Islay. Peaty, but with a good malt background and a lot of fruity notes. Great way to ease your friends into more challenging Islays!\n","\nI like this whiskey very much. Mild and round taste. One of my favorite whiskeys in the world\n","\nSome people on here have compared this whisky to the Laphroaig Quarter Cask or called this a \"peat monster.\" It is nothing like the Quarter Cask, which is a great, powerful Islay with a long, brush fire finish. It's also not a peat monster, even when compared to any of the standard Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Lagavulin expressions. It is less challenging than the Bowmore 12-year, which is the lightest, least peaty\/smoky Islay I keep in my collection. Compared to other Islays, this is a children's drink. There's nothing wrong with that. Everyone likes different things. Drinking ultra smoky Scotch doesn't make you more of a man (or woman). I'm just saying that it's wrong to call a Kool-Ade Islay anything like the Quarter Cask or any actual peat monster.\n","\nI'm not a whiskey drinker but I really like this one great flavour\n","\nWow who is Billy A?? His palette couldn't be more perceptive or more accurate.\nA bit harsh but hence the price point... The best in it's $35 class by far. Complex and not boring, just have to get past the burn. The style mentioned above is dead on in each category. Not a ton of body, light but complex. I might actually rate the smoke at 2.5 but that isn't on their scale - rounding up to 3 seems appropriate.\nThe sweetness didn't rob anything and does compliment the mix. Lemongrass and sage would be two additional tasting notes I'd like to throw to the mix. Smoke flavor lingers a long time but is never over powering. Sweet lime finish but not zesty.\n","\nNot a good scotch can't taste the smoke. Very medicinal tasting. I will not buy again\n","\nIt seems to be marketed at people, like me who have not tried islay whisky before. It's a nice dram and good introduction. The bourbon cask gives it an accessible sweetness. You get a smack of coconut which gives way to light peat, TCP and vanilla. I thought it was good value. I wouldn't necessarily buy again not because it was bad but as I am keen to explore islay whisky further.\n","\nI quite like this, and seem to discover something new about it every time I drink it. Tonight I realized there is a distinct and lovely note of chocolate covered toasted coffee bean.\n","\nThey must have radically changed the recipe for this recently. This is a full metal jacket, balls to the wall, peat-monster. Very enjoyable and better balance than the 12 year old. TCP bandages in honey. Very nice if you like that sort of thing which I do. A nice drying finish makes this a deliciously moreish dram.\n","\nSurprisingly good quality. Not quite sure why people are so snooty about this whisky but people generally treat Bowmore whiskies as the ginger step child of the whisky world, and they're quite wrong.\nThis is a deliciously smoky sweet whisky with a very tasty and moresish dryness which reminds me of the fine balance of Highland Park.\nIt's a great whisky. Probably on a par with something like Laphroaig Quarter Cask but with distinctive Bowmore freshness.\n","\nLovely dram. Gentle tasting though immediately Bowmore. Just let it breath for a few minutes in the glass and enjoy as it comes. No h2o required imho. I received a bottle for Christmas and I would buy again myself.\n","\nThis is a nice smoky peaty whisky but not over powering. Decent length from the Bourbon barrel and at the price it's a good inexpensive alternative to the \u00a340 12yo and upwards.\n","\nThis is the first Bowmore whiskey I've had that I really didn't care for. It tastes very raw and unfinished to me. Of course, I've only had 12 year or older bottles in the past and I'm not a fan of bourbon so I probably should have given my selection more thought.\n","\nI bought this on offer at a reasonable price. It is a perfectly acceptable whiskey, but is just lacking. The peat is so subtle it is pointless and the finish is that of a cheap blend. Easy to drink, but instantly forgettable.\n","\nStrong peat signal, but balanced. A little light in the mouth somehow. Attractively priced, but not a knockout.\n","\nMy new Favorites. Got couple as the price was reasonable.\n","\nI'm new to scotch whiskies and this was the first bottle I picked up. It was a great price for a first bottle.

YUM!","Very ordinary, a good entry level malt for those who want to start with the peated ones but not much more, very banal and lacks flavor","A very good malt, and excellent value for money.","An excellent dram which ticks all my boxes. Not harsh , easy drinking, full of flavour, caramel and BBQ  smoke","This is an exceptional value for money dram. A gentle entry level Islay that is equal parts sweet\/smoke. On my 3rd bottle... Just glides down effortlessly.","Like all the other Bowmores I have tasted before. A disappointment. Very little of any kind of taste, with or without water.","First of, I am fairly new to single malts and tasting. Have started buying myself a few bottles to try and compare, and this was on offer at Tesco, so why not. I am struggling with the tastes so far. The nose is great, as expected. The citrus and lime in the taste and finish are too overpowering in my opinion. Im taking larger sips than I am used to to try and get the smoke to balance it out. Will have another try at it later!","Really nice, chose this over an Aberlour 12 and a Highland Park 12 simply because I enjoy the Islay flavours the best. Hasn't disappointed, the taste is quite light, yet still has that distinctive Islay peaty\/smokey flavour, almost like a mild Laphroaig. I wouldn't water this down too much to open the flavours\/add too much ice as I like a bit of a kick with the taste.\nWould definitely buy again and would recommend to friends who might find the stronger tasting Islay malts too much. In all, a good first bottle of Bowmore at a good price.","First Islay malt I've ever bought, smelt very nice but the taste was not what I was used to. However after a second drop with just a dash of water, the flavours really developed. I prefer the Speyside malts but this is a nice malt","Not my favourite Islay distillery, I got given a bottle of Bowmore Small Batch Reserve-and was pleasantly surprised...where as the 12 year old somehow fails (I kept wondering if that below sea-level warehouse has something to do with it?) THIS makes up for. Obviously not the peatiest whisky, phenol fans\/smokeheids will no doubt be making for the Island's Southern distilleries (suggestion: head N.E. to Caol Ila, too-I'm sure you have already...and you could do worse than try the [Bruichladdich produced]'Port Charlotte Peat Project' over West...)I found this to be a very pleasant malt, no doubt the ex-Bourbon casks having much to do with the result. As for the below sea-level warehouse, hmmmmm. Well...Slainte!"],"119":null,"120":["\nA great balance between smooth and complex. In this price class, the oddly translucent Benrinnes delivers a surprising depth of flavor, breaking the usual color correlations of mid to mid-high range whiskeys. Prominent dark aromas like cocao and espresso almost mask the slight smokiness and a hint of tutti frutti. The short swallow reveals a mild fig-like sweetness, teasing the tutti frutti once again. A longer pull justifies the years noted on the bottle, with the expectations brought forth by the aroma made whole. The slight bourbon-esque fuses with a fruitiness of the berry family. Thicker sweet fruits, like the fig from the first impression make a reappearance, albeit in a second rank.\nThe whole experience surprises, from a boring looking bottle with a cheap bright color, to a friendly multidimensional travel through the more typical of flavors. A great bottle for the junior whiskey fanatic who wishes to expand his territory, without having to break his spirit with ashtrays and caskstrength.\n"],"121":null,"122":["\nVery drinkable \u2013 delicious.\n","\nLove it.

As I drink it, it makes me think of eating freshly caught fish cooked over a wood fire, sitting on a cliff watching the waves crash against the rocks. The only word I can use to describe this whisky is magical. The aroma is sweet yet pleasantly smoky. The initial taste mostly consists of brine and peat smoke, but as you let the flavour develop in your mouth, it evolves into a lovely sweetness, with nice hints of wildflower. As you swallow it again evolves, bringing out pepper notes. This whisky may not be the smoothest out there, but all the flavours still harmonise perfectly, but in a way that each flavour gets its turn to shine, like an excellent orchestra.

I received a bottle of Talisker 10 Year old as 60th Birthday present. It is the best tasting Whisky I have ever drank. Beautiful smokey after taste.","This is my second, perhaps my third bottling and it is the same every time; Absolutely majestic. The thing about Talisker 10 is the balance between the sweet richness to counter balance the peppery smoke and brine of the coast. Excellent stuff","My favorite single  malt. Love the briny note that I sometimes get.","Excellent whisky & good value for money. Definitely be buying more Talisker 10yo.","Very complex taste in my opinion, but tastes great! Smokey, spicy, sweet fruit-ish taste with a pinch of seasalt. This brand and year going to be on my shelf for years to come.","One of my favorites with a nice balance of dried fruit sweetness, smoke, pepper, and a bit of peat. Developed a delicious toffee flavor at the finish. Delicious!","I have never left a review for an alcohol before. However, this bottle merits it. I am not new to single malt scotches. My father keeps Glenfiddich 12yr - 15yr - 18yr, Lagavualin 16yr, Laphroaig 10 yr, Balvenie 12yr, and Glenlivet 12yr in our cabinet at all times, (and many other bottles), and I have grown up tasting these scotches my entire life. All of these scotches have their merits and occasions. However, Talisker, is without a doubt my favorite by a mile. I'm not experienced with giving tasting notes, and as such I cannot put into words what I like about Talisker so much. Also, I see that some reviewers have stated that the \"taste\" of Talisker has changed in the past few years, which certainly has not happened (at least in the past 7 years or so). There is a quality that distinguishes Talisker from all other single malts, and this quality grows on you with time. I think I appreciate the flavor and feel of Talisker more and more each time I try it. I can identify a Talisker instantly nowadays, and it is always a superb and enjoyable flavor.","Like drinking sea water, not the best bottle to start getting into talisker, better with 57 north.","It's a pretty nice whisky. If I have it with some food, like a pizza, it's quite good, I also had it with sushi and loved that as well. On a clean palate it's a bit rough, somewhat too soapy for my tastebuds. But overall still smooth and easy to drink. I had a bottle about a year ago and I don't remember the soapy quality, in fact I remember it as being quite a bit better...","This is an excellent whisky that tends to get grouped in with the Islay whiskies. It really should be included with the coastal whiskies. Think Oban or Old Pulteney. On the nose you get malt and fruit with a little smoke mixed in. On the palate heavy malt with some smoke and brine. The finish is long and peppery. I tend to favor sherried highland\/speyside whiskies or heavily peated Islay whiskies. Whiskies like this are great for a change of pace.","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nRefined smoke.  Lemon bread.  Very enjoyable.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nLight bodied.  Sweet malted barley followed by billowing smoke and banana.  And finally the peppercorns appear.   \n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nDrying sea salt, slight dulse and brine.  \n\nGeneral Impressions\nTired of the Speyside honey\/cinammon flavor profile?  If so, try Talisker.","Nice and pinching peach smoke taste on the tongue which lingers on to become a sweet malt after taste.\nAn enjoable whiskey at room temperature one of the best 10 year old whiskeys","The Benchmark of peaty malts - love this one and could drink anytime only beaten by Lagavulin in my humble opinion.  Incredible malt for 10 year old and great price.","Lovley and a very beautiful Test!","Though the nose suggests sweet malt, I found dry white pepper and slight brine w\/ mild and pleasant smoke, to a smoked salmon and cracked pepper finish pleasant and enjoyable.  Thinner and less richness than some, but versatile and more often welcome.","The first sip I ever had, I thought it tasted exactly like cedar plank smoked salmon and it turned me off because I wasn''t expecting it. Then 6 months later I bought a bottle on a whim because I couldn''t stop thinking about this bizarre fish whisky. The more I drank, the less \"fishy\" it became and more so it resembled sweet, salty, smoky, peppery barbecue sauce with a hint of sea air. Not my favorite because I love it, but one of my favorites because I can''t forget it. You could blindfold me and I''ll always know Talisker.","Very pleasant, will try again.","Unbelievable. I''ve tried a fair amount of scotches across the board now, and I have to say that this is one of the best. Laphroaig I found just far too punishing to be enjoyable other than to a select crowd, but Talisker has just the right amount of smoke to give it tremendous flavour without entering the realm of ridiculous. Beautiful hit of tangy fruit right off the bat and a full mouthfeel combined with a lingering and sweet smokiness that simply has to be experienced. An experience...I can feel the sea spray and hear the roar of the ocean when tasting this one.","A very enjoyable smoke in this one. It lingers immensely without overpowering the silky flow. Pleasantly surprised.","Traditionally compared to the Islay malts, however this dram tastes somewhat neutered to me. It is sad, if indeed the character of the whisky has changed from what it was before. Back to Lagavulin and Laphroaig for me.","Don''t  be put off by the low rating compared to other whiskeys,  This is a fine whiskey","Talisker 10 y.o has certainly lost its way.  It is definitely sweeter and has lost the smack of seaweed and pepper that it used to have.","Great blend of smoke and sweetness - with fire to finish! Very enjoyable.","Was dubious to try, some bad feedback on here. Gotta say I love it :)","FM, there is nothing wrong with your tastebuds, Talisker 10 is not what used to be. Considerably sweeter and duller than few years ago. I think it''s because of new cheaper production methods which intend to meet growing  demand.","What happened Talisker?\n\nI reviewed this on 27th November 2012 and thought it was fantastic; at the time, it was my all-time-favorite. Haven''t drunk it for a while and bought a new bottle recently.  I''ve been mainly drinking American whiskeys at home, with the odd Highland Scotch here and there. \n\nI don''t know if my palette has changed in the 2 years since but now it just doesn''t taste as good.  It''s harsher than it was and adding water doesn''t seem to help.  The flavors don''t seem to combine the way they did and there''s an aftertaste that lingers in a slightly unpleasant way.  \n\nStill decent (3 stars)  but not what it was IMO.","This is the first time I had to practise with a whisky, it made me work. I wasn't sure about it\nat first but at around the half way point of a small bottle, something clicked!\nI've not tried an abundance of whisky I must say, but this is complex treat and the \"explosion\" from the\nback of the mouth that people talk about is definitely true. \nI would get this again it is truly worth a try and I think one of the few that live up\n to the hype","Talisker 10 year old certainly tops the single malts. This a favourite of mine amongst other Talisker Single Malts. Talisker is the best Single Malt Whisky that I have had. Slainte","Very nice Island malt. Could really taste the sea salt and nice flow of smoke. Perfect winter warmer.","Nose: Big peat smoke and iodine with integrated sweetness. Palate: Big, smoky, intense, explosive in the back of the mouth yet obviously sweet and fruity. Restless dram yet somehow well-balanced between nose and palate, full of character. No water needed. Brilliant winter dram. Is there a better and more consistent Islander at 10 YO of age? I don't think so.","As Ruaraidh says above, the awful Covent Garden ad agency-style packaging almost put me off buying what turned out to be a reasonably-priced and great-tasting whisky, certainly packing the briny tang other critics have noted here. This is only the second good whisky I have tried after a bottle of The Dalmore 15-years-old; the journey ahead looks set to be an enjoyable one.","Surprised by all the comments about this whiskey's peatiness. I'm no fan of Islay whiskeys, but this one IMO, is awesome. No big peaty flavor, just delicious honey, smokey flavor.","This is one of the great whiskies, It should be in every drinks cupboard.This is the one bottle I would not leave behind.","Talisker is a phenomenal 10yr. Bottled at a higher strength with a depth and complexity that will amaze newcomers and also satisfy the most experienced palates. Unless you can't stand any peat in your whisky this is definitely one everyone must try.","I think Talisker is one of the great whiskies. No gimicks just a super whisky to enjoy on your own after a busy day, or with friends and family.\r\nAll Island whiskies are something special, and to my mind this is the best.","One of the most popular malts around and rightly so, there's something about this Island malt that helps it endure. Sweet smokiness, depth, maritime salt - just gorgeous really. Definitely one to have on your shelf once you're making your way boldly into the wonderful world of scotch.","My favourite winter mountain biking dram.","It's still the \"Go To\" single malt in this price range - the older Taliskers are just sublime, a testimony to the art of whisky making, but I have to say the new packaging for the ten is really tacky, it very nearly put me off buying a replacement for the one I just finished.","Been a fan of this for a few years: absolutely stonking whisky.  It combines smoky and sweet flavors perfectly IMO.  Great value too.","This is my kind of whisky for a winters night. Someone described it as \"liquid Harris Tweed,\" and both keep you warm.I think it is very good value for money and worth trying. Hope you like it as well.","After tasting over one hundred different malts I can tell this: As an overall impression, this is simply the best whisky of them all!\r\nAlthough it is an isle product, it combines the isle and the highland  aroma in a best possible way! As Tina Turner would put it: Simply the best!","big let down for me to much smoke i think","really, really big flavor. is it better than laphroaig? not in my opinion, is it of the same quality? no sadly, i think i rate laphroaig too high.\nhowever at the price, and the extra strength these little differences are do not add up too all that much.\npersonally i think it is the best value for money for any peat lover, it is also a change from islay. 87.5\/100","Where have you been all my life! Got Talisker 10 year old as a bithday present at my 50 years birthday. There is no way back, absolutely spendid whisky!","This single malt has everything going for it and is excellent value for money: Strong flavours mainly peat and oak a very warming malt and at 45.8% the alcohol effect is quick to hit home, perfect for winter sat in front of a roaring fire.","Currently my favourite whisky (mind you this changes regularly). This ticks almost every box for me (price, value, taste..). Ideal for those who like the smokey aspect of a whisky but find Laphroaig a little too harsh","Simply the best 10 year old on the market! Never had a bad Talisker out of their range!","Absolutely a fan of this from today. Wow. Far more complex than Laphroaig. Layered, deep, sweet,full, love the banana, burnt-sugar, wow, such a find. On special today, from 4300 yen, to 3500 yen. So worth the splurge. Like good wine, Scotch is deserving of a few more pennies. YUM.","This is a good malt if you want something thats got a decent kick, spicy flavor, and a hint of smoke at the end of it all. If you find you like the smoke then skip this and jump up to an Ardbeg or a  Laphroaig (haven't tried Lagavulin yet)","This was my very first single malt, before I knew anything about peat.  I was blown away by its magnificence then.  10 years on I still am.","When I had a sip of this I fell in love with whisky. Definitely best whisky from supermarket range.","Amazing maturity for a 10 year old whisky. First sip if you are new to it may be a bit much, however, once you get used to the peatyness the flavour keeps coming and never gets boring, far superior in my opinion to Laphroaig 10 y o. At 45.8% it's pretty strong stuff. Real cork closure is a nice touch.","\"Nose\" (undiluted):  Refined smoke.  Lemon bread.  Very enjoyable.\"Palate\" (undiluted):  Light bodied.  Sweet malted barley followed by billowing smoke and banana.  And finally the peppercorns appear.  \"Finish\" (undiluted): Drying sea salt, slight dulse and brine.","Seriously you can't go wrong with this.  And a whisky thats THAT good for THAT price? They're practically giving the stuff away! In Talisker we trust.","One of the best 10 year old whiskies you can buy,enough said.","Ah, Talisker 10... The original firewater! Smoke","I expected it to be very much like Caol Ila but the peat is not at all as much \"in your face\" like some Islay whiskies. On the nose: Soft peat, sea salt, sweetness.On the palate: Soft, very well-rounded earthy peat, followed by a sort of dried-fruit sweetness and then a wee note of salt and spice.Finish: Peat, fruit-sweetness.A very good whisky. If your tired of hard, up front, in your face peat\/smoke from Islay, try this. Skye won't disappoint you!","This is one of the best malts and it shows that a great scotch does not need to be aged for decades and priced in the hundreds of dollars. For me, this is on par with many costing several times more.","Don't let that peppery-ness sneak up on you, otherwise you'll feel like someone just let of a grenade back there.All in all a good malt.","Talisker is definitely on the dry side and packs a punch with its higher ABV. The tingly, spirity booze burns its way around your mouth, loading you up with its golden brown malt. Clean pure whisky flavor all around with some peat and minimal smoke. It becomes peppery like tequila can be, more towards the finish. Not very spicy in the way I prefer, but I appreciate this one. Adding water would not seem right. It's a strong drink and the bartender didn't think I could handle it!","The single malt that awoke my palate. I had occasionally enjoyed Laphroaig and always kept a bottle on my shelf. One day I ran out and tried Talisker out of curiosity. There was the sea salt, the smoke, and very little of the iodine, then the thing just kept up evolving and ended up with that pepper after taste. For the first time it made me pay attention to all phases of the tasting process. That is what really turned me onto single malts as my favorite drink","One of the best single malts!! Love the taste, so smooth!!","To drink this is to be in Scotland...","A very pleasant, yet fiery young single malt. As a fan of Islay whiskies it took me a while to fully appreciate the slightly sweeter taste of Talisker, but now that the bottle is almost empty I consider it on par with the Laphroaigs and Bowmores of the same age - and perhaps even higher than them. Still, I'm going with some older Taliskers next in search of an even more balanced and deeper taste. 8 out of 10","Forget the silly descriptions of the flavours.  Buy a bottle, rent a cottage on Skye, and wait for a cold, wet, evening.  (Not usually a long wait.)Light a fire, pour a large one, and enjoy it slowly.","Crispy caramel banana sweetness in front with a big kick of pepper dryness in the middle then a peaty top note. This one you can roll around and around your mouth for a long time picking out the different levels. The texture is right in the middle between light and thick, perfect for rolling.","Enjoyed this very much. Not as peaty as some of the islay malts, but very nicely balanced all the same. The nose is alluring and wets the appetite, the palate is robust with sweetness and peat at the same time, but the finish is the best - peppery with a long driving warming finish. Exceptional.","Green pepper, soda, tabasco sauce, moldy wood, cheap leather,  cheese, banana, baby's puke(?!)  Very sweet entry, moldy, peat, spicy, smoke, sour.  Pepper dry finish.  It took me sometime to get used to it, but now I LOVE it...","This whisky is absolutely gorgeous and like it or not, makes the best whisky sour I've ever had.","Unfortunately I found this to be overly peaty.  I drank it, it was decently enjoyable, but I will not be purchasing it again.","my fav always","Absolutely out of this world, having had most SM, Talisker is a revelation and truly wish had known of it before.","this is an amazing whisky. Something i cant stop drinking. well worth every penny. Highly recommended. ive tried many but this is my personal favorite right now. Smoky, complex, beautiful!","This scotch will wake up your tongue and pallet!

Throughly disappointed, don't judge a book by its cover. Compared to similar priced options, it has no complexity or depth of flavour. It tastes like whisky so I suppose that's worth a star.

On the nose it reminds me of a hot pancake breakfast. There's a woody smell that's remind me of sweet maple syrup and butter. On the palate I really get the delicious sherried fruit. There is also a nice spice to it. On the nice long finish the sweet fruit dries leaving a pleasant peppery spicy aftertaste. I also get the hint of smoke that the producer mentions.

A little peppery on the finish.","A great lighter style whisky - perfect as an introduction to whisky.","Sweet with fresh citrus","At first the smell of animal urine and over yeastsed biscuits.  I gave it a week and it got better. I decanted it for a few more weeks and it's one of my favorites now","Excellent","Excellent and real value for money a drunk of this quality.","A nice all around smooth drink. Easily likeable.","Very light and delicate, hints of honey and salted caramel. Too easy to drink the whole bottle....","I bought this when I visited Edinburgh, Scotland. I loved the floral notes. I had to be careful to sip not drink. I am also a big fan of Glenmorangie and Oban. That's my taste.","Absolutley loved it. Came across it in the Whiskey room at Cameron house Loch Lomond. Was recommended by the waiter, and I have to say a very easy smooth drink, that can be enjoyed any time.","Was not too impressed. Has a grainy, creamyness to it which is decent. Kinda reminded me of an Irish blend in some respects. Overall was not happy with the price spending over 50.00 USD on it. Many other malts I would rather spend my cash on.","Very pleasant to drink a lighter taste whisky. This is a Lowland malt that should be tried, It would be hard not to like it.","Extremely smooth and light. A delight to drink","A sipping whisky better after the second tasting, with flavours of marzipan and subtle floral notes. Rewards a little patience as it opens out slowly in the glass developing strongly with a little warmth from your hand. One to be savoured - a little time and effort brings sweet grassy and floral dividends.","This is a typical Lowland malt which isn't peaty, but has a strong floral aroma, hints of pear and is quite sweet.  A dash of water or ice opens it up.  If your after peat, go for an Islay malt.","It took almost the whole bottle until I found these deep layers flavor. I am a Islay man, but this is very good stuff. Much more patient is needed with these Lowland malts, but in Glenkinchie there are rewarding floral and fruity tones.","Incredible stuff, rich and floral with layers of unfolding flavour, and a wonderful aroma.  The finish leaves you with the surprising taste of peat (not wasabi and bare alcohol, as a previous review stated).","Starts out fine with honey, whisps of smoke, virtually no peat, but then on the finish takes a turn for the worse, with wasabi and bare alcohol.  Unpleasant finish.  This is too expensive for what you get.","A very nice single malt, as a fan of Irish Whiskey this proves to be a very smooth drink with a hint of pear you cant go wrong.","Lovely drink, light and floral, a real girls drink and I want some more ASAP!","A lovely malt.  Give it some time to open up and it rewards with a delicious aroma and exquisite bittersweet flavours.","depends on your taste.. if you're after rich and peaty then forget it, go for something like Lagavulin instead. If you like something light smooth and easy-going then you'll be very happy with this.","Just toned down, if you ask me. I quite liked it when I had tooth ache but the second tasting was a disappointment. Not bad by any means, but not terribly exciting, either.","A very \"well rounded\"  whiskey with a smooth flavour and just a touch of smokiness. Sort of like a toned down Talisker IMHO.","A very smooth very easy to drink whiskey. The best I have tried yet, and the only one I truly enjoy. Highly recomended to try. Recomended to me in Melrose"],"136":["\n A nice smooth single Malt for those who want an easy going drink, but I was expecting more. It lacks somewhat on the wow-factor and is a little too plain in my opinion. From the scent, through the sip to the aftertaste nothing seems to change and no new flavours develop or appear.\n","\nI had high hopes for this one as it follows on from the amazing Jura Origin 10 year old... but sadly this one was so bad I couldn't finish the glass! Please Jura go back to what you do best.\n","\nI was a fan of the Jura origin which is no loner available. This is still fairly mild on the peaty, smokey notes but its there enough to make it interesting. Leaves a nice slightly spicy feeling on the lips and is quite warming on the way down. If youre after something easy drinking to suit all palates, not too light or too peaty this should fit the bill. I love it!\n","\nWas looking forward to the subtle flavors shining through. I was hoping for a mellow taste with low peat after taste to stand out and take notice. The overall experience of my first taste gave me that hope that will forever stand in my taste buds as just that. The peat is mild compared to others in the same class of single malts. I also purchased at the same time the 18 yr but have not opened it to give a review but will in the near future. I give it four stars today in hopes that future bottling's remain as adverse but subtle in taste as I have come to appreciate in the finer bottling's of single malts.\n","\nFirst impression had nice peatiness on the nose, but a rather uninteresting mix of brown sugar and spices. I was originally unimpressed with this Jura 10 (only 3 stars), but after deciding to give it one last shot, I noticed interesting chocolate and other flavors that I hadn't before. Probably the biggest disappointment about this single malt is that I feel like I paid too much for something only decent. But it was worth giving it a few tries. Jura seems to be a well regarded island disillery. I definitely have Seven Wood in mind to try next.\n","\nwow\n"],"137":["\nAberlour is probably one of my favorite single malts. Definitely one of the smoothest in character, can be enjoyed while sipping just like a golden anejo rum. Very pleasurable, a good beginning to start drinking scotch because it won't cause you to make a face when downing a wee drop. Will spoil you for many others in this category, since it's a tad expensive.\n","\nIf you love sherry,low alcohol and age then this is a must\n","\nMy third time with a speyside malt, the first being a disappointing Macallan Gold, & a rather boring Aberfeldy 12, this is a really good one.\nThe nose: very mild spice (can be mistaken for alcohol but thats quite far from the truth) can tell immediately it will be sweet, lots of caramel\/vanilla, also sherry driven. Reminds me of an excellent bourbon thats not spiky whatsoever.\nMy tasting notes for this one: the arrival is sweet but also spicey like cinnamon, there are lots of caramel & vanilla notes, but also really deep sherry fruits, for me I get red apple, maybe raisins.\nAs a person who enjoys peated (strong or mild) whiskies again, this one reminds me a lot of a quality bourbon!!\nDangerously drinkingable neat, have not tried with ice but can imagine it would be even smoother than it already is.\n","\nIt's very easy to compare whiskies but oh my what a mistake. This is a benchmark whisky. Wonderful Speyside, a classic. Full, textured and oh so sippable. It calls for respect.\n","\nAverage whiskey overall.\nNose: oaky, notes of pear and honey\nPalate: Overpowering oak, if you add just a little bit off water the buttery sweet almost pear taste comes through\nFinish: Raisins and herbal\nNothing very special, I find the oak flavor a bit too powerful, even if only 40% I find the alcohol flavor to be strong. It hides the notes of sweet butter and pear. However, worth its price.\n","\nVery smooth whisky with a hint of sherry and chocolate. This has become my \"go to\" single malt. Well priced for a truly superb whisky!!\n","\nA sherry sweet whisky with an initial butter note followed by spicy finish. Little unbalanced on the alcohol component to finish - daresay this will dissipate in the older whiskies. Tasty - definitely a well made Highlander. 3.5\/5 (damn this lack of 1\/2 stars!)\n","\nI am just getting into Scotch. Aberlour 12 was referred to me by a friend (who has a lot more experience with Scotch than I do). I was blown away by the flavor and smoothness of this whisky!\n","\nPicked up this whisky earlier today and gave it a try. A decent amount of sherry and a lot of dark fruit. If you like sweeter whisky, this is probably for you.\n","\nI see from the notes that under \"smoke\" the rating is 0.\nI find that hard in that I find a West coast smoke, which is unpleasant - is it just my taste buds? I have been an avid Speyside man for 40 years.\n","\nVery easy to drink, smooth buttery feel. Taste is sweet with a hint of spice. Over the past 2 or 3 years I have gotten into drinking and appreciating whiskies.

Absolutely nothing special or mentionable.\n","\nTried this one at a whiskey show last spring and since have made sure to always have a bottle in my house.

I'm partial to the smoky Scotch but this is a great departure. Excellent!\n","\nAberlour 12 had some tough competition at the time we first tried it, since we also got a bottle of Lagavulin 16 the same day. And yet ever since, this sweet and pleasant but rather simple scotch has never really stood out to us all that much, even though we've gone through much of the bottle. I saw it on sale at a screaming deal of $32 at the grocery store, but didn't think it was worth buying when for a few dollars more I could get something I liked better. At least this is preferable to the similarly sherried Macallan 12, which I think needs a little water.

Nothing you'll remember for ages, nothing special in fact, but the same time pretty good, tasty, good value for the money. Pleasant, definitely not the \"Love-it-or-hate-it\"-type. The Ford Mondeo among the Single Malts. In fact it's 3 1\/2 stars.","An inoffensive and somewhat unclear nose, but to my taste clear and sweat, with a bit of peaty-heat to its afterfinish.","A pleasant nose and palate for a non-peated dram.

Very enjoyable. Smooth as any whisky I\u2019ve ever tried.","Very nice tasting whisky and warm finish due to the cinnamon and spices","One of the best single malts for the money.  Non peated with fruity notes. No artificial color. Actually, to be perfectly honest, this 12 year double cask would pass for 3 times the price.  Other brands that I have are great or I wouldn\u2019t drink them but this is great value in my area. Almost too good to be true. My advice is to buy some and try it!","Not my style since I am on the peat style whiskeys but this is very good for a non peated whiskey. One of the best I can say and close to the great Japanese, Nikka and Hibiki that I think are probably the best sweet style whiskeys","I really like it,  very smooth and the smell is fantastic","not much complexity. bland. we can do better","Nothing to talk about.....","thought it to be very weak and bland, not much complexity","i test it and buy it .\nlike it very much .\nsmooth and tasty .","Tried it for the first time, just because it was new to my liquor store.  I could not be happier, well balanced.  Have a friend who tried it and is now asking for a bottle on his Christmas stocking.","Having bought the 10 I though I should try the 12, as you do.\r\n\r\nThe 12 is vastly superior to the 10 and worth every penny of what ever extra you pay.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s absolutely beautiful and if like me you happen to pick it up for a good price then you will be one very lucky chap\/chapet indeed!","All things considered, this is simply excellent.","I do agree with the previous review to mine that that it dosen't leave a strong taste in your throat after you have drunk it.\nBut I will say apart from that this uncomplicated 12 year old whisky to drink however it is very classy.\nBeautiful color  a great aroma  and very sweet and easy to drink.\nI have yet to taste the 10 year old but I am definetly going to buy that to!","I have to say, as much as I love the taste and smell of this whisky, it doesn't last at all. The taste is gone almost as soon as it's gone down your throat leaving you with no lasting satisfaction. It's a shame, too, because this whisky --  as I mentioned -- smells and tastes dreamy.\n\nThis will be a whisky I take to a friend's or share with a whisky virgin.  It's rich and not remotely harsh, which is nice if you're after mild like I am. I'd rate this much higher if the taste lingered, and I'm sure you will too. I'd only buy this again on sale.","Extremely smooth and buttery. A bit towards sweet. Very good for the price","Magnificent buy it","Sweet and straight forward. It has the sweet fruit taste and chocolate notes which are expressed in many reviews and notes. But it is not one of the greats. The finish is not long on the palette and it is simple.","I am a big peat fan but I always like the Aberlour 12.  A rich, full bodied taste, always a pleasure to drink any time of the year.  Smooth and mellow with hints of vanilla, nutmeg and licorice.","This is probably the best value for your money scotch. It outperforms whiskies that cost $20 more.  Smooth, sweet with some nice spice and wood. Very well balanced. Great Speyside malt, and I'm a guy who's usually an Islay drinker.","Nose very great explosive taste one of the best for the price very good this is a everyday scotch to have ! Lots of flavour that you have to have all the times!!!","It's a great 12 year old","before I have drunk a lot of brands of Whisly ...but this whisky was amarzing for me... i like the taste flavour, it definitely is  delicious ...","probably one of the sweetest drams I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. Very fruity, smooth and buttery on the palette with Chistmassy spices that add lovely complexity. Just so very nice and a steal at the price. Easily repurchase worthy.","Surprising great taste at a affordable price.  I try new whiskeys every year at christmas and then drink them throughout the year.  This Whiskey's warm flavor had me returning and using up the bottle before January was half over.  Definitely will tell my Maker's Mark friends they need to give over to a new brand Aberlour.","Bought a bottle after hearing good things, and i wasnt disappointed. Really rich dried fruits on the nose with apple and cinammon. The palate is more of the same  followed by a really nice oak charr. Great stuff after a meal.","For the price, it is a great sherry dram. I would rate it better than Glendronach, and below Glenfarclas.","I was very disappointed by this expression. This whisky doesn't lack for richness, but, there is no smoothness or nuance, here -- a distasteful alcohol burn and accompanying heat dominate and overwhelm everything else on the palate. Frankly, I found Dewar's White Label to be a vastly superior whisky to this offering. In my opinion, Aberlour 12 is inferior to Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask, Glengoyne 10, Glenfiddich 12 and most every other single malt or blended Scotch that I've ever tried. I'll avoid this one like the plague.","Wonderfully warm and easy to drink. Great for the hip flask also!","I had some A'bunadh (approx 1\/6 btl.) left (batch 53 at 59.7% abv) and deciddd to combine it with a bottle of the 12 which created a hybrid of approx 43-44% abv and the result was an astoundingly great dram","Fruity and sweet.","Nice rich taste, raisins come through stronger than the cinamon.","A very flavorful single malt but I do prefer juice that is 100 pf. & above. That being said this is my go to when I'm in the mood for a \"quiet\" Scotch","Smooth and tasty. Worth getting another bottle.","100% on the Notes from Billy A.  Most notably, from the pages intro, I find this malt much LESS in the fruit senses than say The Glenlivet which I always love the Pear and other fruit from the Nose to the Palate.  Arberlour is a Rich, Cigar Box of Natural woody flavors, where I find the Sherry maturation provides just the balance to make this a SOLID performer!","Beautiful taste, full bodied whiskey with hints of cinnamon, delicious evening dram","Best value Speyside malt at this range...well balanced and makes for a beautiful dram.  Never had a bad Aberlour","First tasted this at a hotel in Stellenbosch. Beautiful and smooth. Promptly forgot its name and needed to go back to the hotel as a reminder. Glad I did and nowxi have a bottle of my own.","Stunning dram. Soft, smooth, sweet Christmas cake , fresh oak, a touch of water opens it up and it is just delicious. No harshness, it just says ' more'. For the money it is a first class malt.","My first foray into this whiskey. I've only been a whiskey drinker for three months....and this is one of the best that I've tasted so far. When I'm a more experienced whiskey drinker I'll leave a more detailed review...but so far this is for me a smooth drop and a good flavour. Top 5 so far.","A bit bland. I was expecting more.","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nCloves, nutmeg and cinnamon sticks.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nInitial spiced dark currants, cherry, over-ripe black grapes, transitions mid-palate to a teensy weensy bit raw, unadulterated alcohol.  Brackish water comes to mind.\n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nSome smoke.  A little green and a tinge of bitterness accompanies the taste of sherry and oak at the end.","In my opinion this whiskey falls in between the Dalmore 12 yr. and the Balvenie 12 yr. doublewood. It's not as dry as the Dalmore and doesn't have the bourbon like sweetness of the Balvenie although I think it leans more towards sweetness. On the nose there is a pleasant smell of maple syrup and butter. The palate has some of that sweetness mixed with raisins and vanilla. You also taste a lot of woody oak. The finish has more raisins and oak. All in all a good easy drinking whisky","I'm a scotch drinker since I was 17. (Now I'm 64). I got a bottle of Aberlour 12 for my birthday and I'm in love with it! I'll choose it over Glen Livet 15 or The Balvenie from now on.","Great value for money. Excellent, smooth, balanced and lot of fun.","Great scotch at a great price. I was treated to a scotch tasting at the Indy Scottish games a couple of years ago and was thrilled to explore the a ubundance of flavors and feels. After I heard the prices, I asked for a tasting of scotches from $30-$50.even though it was humorous it was a bit tongue in cheek, with a lot of truth from my wallet. Fast forward a year or so and I ran into a balviene double wood. I had some, and I had some more letting my glenmoragie, another decent price brand, fill the glasses of my friends in the band, and spoiled my self on the Balviene. When I went to buy some it was at a difficult price to explain to my wife albeit very moderate for a good single malt. As I looked at the offerings, I noticed the arberlour 12, and saw the same double cask process described, and after a bit of questioning the clerks who knew little about it, I just bit the bullet and bought another scotch, taste unknown, at $20 less hoping for the best. Little did I know that I had made my best scotch decision of my first year of scotch discovery. It's a great malt smooth and full of flavors, sweet and aromatic, soft on the palate, mild and spicy, with a tremendous flavor of sweet fruits and flowers in a long finish well after swallowing. An awesome scotch value and flavor. This is a single malt in my previously mentioned price range that will find a place in my limited liquor stocks for some time. By the way I took the first bottle to a gathering of my friends in the band and got about 2 drams before I went to get a plate of food. When I got back to the studio the arberlour was gone and I was offered as much \"famous grouse red\" as I wanted, a great blend in itself. I just recently ran into \"black and white\" as well. But those are 2 different reviews. Remember always \"Life in kilts is life indeed\"\n-Slainte mhath!","Beautiful on the palat.  Smooth, with lovely butter and cinnamon notes.","Very rich and smooth. Perfect.","Very smooth but not overwhelming.","Although a tad unassuming, this whiskey hits some great notes with a rush of cinnamon and spice while balancing with sweetness.   Great value.   Sips much like the macallan amber.","Bland and boring. If you want a full bodied sweet dram,  I would suggest a bottle of Glenfiddich solera vat. At about the same  cost there is no comparison.","Found this quite anaemic. Never have I tasted a whisky more in need of a higher strength. Its not without charm, but in future I will stick with the sherried loveliness of the standard 10, or opt for the unchillfiltered 12 version.","Got this as a gift and very happy with it. I don't drink a lot of scotch but I do like a bit of Jamesons, so the sweetness is familiar and pleasant. I would probably in future go for something a little more challenging, but in itself there's nothing wrong with it!","Picked up a bottle without knowing a thing about Scotch.  I still no knowing about Scotch Whisky, but I can tell you it tastes damn good","Picked this up on a whim, think it might be the BEST Single Malt I've ever had!","Absolutely delicious. Mellow, pleasant with hints of swetness, smoke, nuts. Complex but extremely drinkable taste! I loved it!","Just lovely. For me, this compares to the Macallan 12 and the Balvenie Doublewood 12.. Please don''t ask me to pick a favourite!","I''m a beer drinker. But bought a box of cigars, and thought I''d have with a shot of scotch. Picked this 12 off the shelf, and wow, very very good. Hard to imagine another scotch could be any better with a cigar. Smooth, clean, and well, just perfect.","I was a huge fan of the Aberlour 10 until a friend persuaded me to give this a try. Suffice to say the 10 is now a lonely fellow","One of my favourites - very smooth and rich, goes down a treat. A must have for any Speyside drinkers!","This is my favorite Scotch of them all. Smooth as silk. I made the mistake of getting my wife to try a dram and she drained it within a week..... And She DOESN''T DRINK!!!!","After trying the 10 I was very wary about buying this, but after finding it on offer I decided to give this a go and I am pleased that I did. The nose is lovely a hint of spice and a strong oak smell to it. On the palate it is a bit thin but has wonderful dried fruits such as currents and the spice comes in full, the two marry together to give a delicious old fashioned fruit cake. The finish lingers for a while but not too much to be overpowering, it''s sweet with a lovely charred oak flavour. Overall I give this 90\/100, I shall try to always have a bottle of this in my collection and I urge you to do the same","I bought Aberlour 12 because Checkout51 had a $2.00 cash back offer.  I''m glad I did.  Wow.  I can go into the layers of complexity, nose, finish, etc.   Suffice it to say it is a fine whiskey.","Great 12 year old - nose & tasting notes are as described in Aberlour website - wonderful Speyside dram at a great price point - will buy again","This is an excellent whisky. I have tried the 10 year old which is a little lacking in finish so I was more than pleasantly surprised by the 12 year old. The nose is fresh with red apples but its the smooth,  chocolaty palate that really blew me away. This follows through to a spicy,  smooth finish with a hint of milk chocolate. I have to say - I like this immensely.  A lovely dram.","Aberlour 12 with it''s sherried, complex character, good balance and a slightly spicy and warming finish, is the best whiskey I have tried( Aberlour 10 and 12 Glenffidich 12, Glenlivet 12, Scapa 16, Dalmore 12, Glenmorangie the original and Quinta Ruban and Ardbeg 10 which must be judged separately) so due to my humble experience and taste, I would give it a first place. I recommend it to all sherry lovers and everyone else. Good stuff, especialy for the price.\r\nHope it helps you make up your mind","With a little drop of water,,,,,wauw","Wonderful. First tried Abelour 10, now this. Cinnamon, chocolate, raisins... Worth paying more than the asking price. My new favourite.","First try of this and wow, complex, spices that tingle my tounge. What I love is the smokiness from the oak, it''s bloody good. \n\nIf you''re offered a glass if this, definitely try it and take your time with it as it is complex.","A very fine whisky. Sweet finish as the discription states, hinting at chocolate. Personally I didn''t smell the cinnamon toast, but the nose has a woody touch to it. Not peaty at all, overall a whisky with a complex range of smells and tastes that last long after sipping, but still easy going.","My wife bought this as NY\/Christmas present to me, considering that  I prefer Speyside single malt whiskey.This  one is ideal for winter holiday evenings, with smooth aroma and slit touch of festive mood.","I brought aberlour whisky for my husband at christmas  so I thought I would try a dabble it is amasing it slides down your throat so smooth we love it","Single malted Scotch is my choice of relax and have a drink.

It is produced to a high consistent standard.  Yes, the alcohol may be slightly detached and is more integrated in 16 year version, but this is a minor flaw. I will be buying more, as it is the best of the popular priced Speysides around.","When you sip Aberlour you know it's going to be dependable and consistent and this 12 year old doesn't dissapoint.  Wonderful sherry notes with a definite chocolate hit. Don't bother with water, just fine as it comes.

It seems to take 15 years as opposed to 12 to make a 40% dring taste like liquid silk. Yes there are more complex and intriguing drinks out there and yes i could possibly just justify spending 8,9,10 times as much on them - but in my opinion this is by a stretch, the biggest bang for your buck.","A balance far overlooked, the 18 year old is a little more complex but is so subdued, this is the best value for your $ a great whiskey.","Smooth!\n\nMy favorite. My signature. My single malt.","I know I reviewed this a week ago but I just moved it up to a 5 star. It is more complex  now that the bottle has had a chance to open up and the sherry influence is more present, sweet and so smooth. Wow, just wow.","Such a great dram, very smooth but not overly complex. This is a wonderful every day whisky at a decent price here in Canada. I really enjoy this with a nice cigar, perfect way to end the week.","Forget what it says on the label. This scotch taste like autumn, like thanksgiving, like pumpkin pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top. Smooth as silk yet spicy and complex, the whiskey is exquisitely enjoyable. If you prefer dark smokey whiskies you might look elsewhere however.","im new to whisky tasting, tried both the 12 and 15 years, very nice sweet fruity smell coming out of my glass :)","Given as gift a few years ago and really enjoyed a dram or three!","Very smooth, definitely the oak, sherry and dark fruit comes through. An enjoyable whisky..","Its nice. Smooth. Subtle. Golden.","Good, but not great. Smooth & easy to drink, nice aroma, well balanced, not a long finish. Good every day Scotch.","Smooth and great.","Just a brilliant basic relaxing moment of the evening. Nothing too amazing, but a solid performance. Just enough sweetness with a hint of fudge and a nice whiskey taste.","Well they taste how they look, 12 year old fresh green fruits apples and pears and 15 year all the same glory with much much bigger cask influnence old spices and sherry notes, there's a reason why Glenfiddich is a top seller in the world... it's a great product for a reasonable price. Very pleasant and tasty malts. I find hints of smoke in it though? it has slight salty note to it too.","Great","Smooth, not smoky at all, pleasant taste with rich flavor.","Smooth, pleasant taste with rich flavor.","According to Glenfiddich the Whisky producers of this product, their 12 year old expression is their signature whisky.  It should be this 15 year old Solara expression.  This is without a doubt one of the finest Whiskies on the market for the price in my opinion.  Although I love the 12 expression, nothing at around ?35.00 beats this one.","My favourite in the glenfiddich range. Value for money every day tipple that has a complexity above its price range. Its popular as it fits the bill for a entry to mid range whiskey that is widely available in the shops. Good advice on this is to take the top off and let it air for an hour before drinking. Something you would do with an expensive bottle but you will notice the flavour change if you try it.","Interesting offering from Glenfiddich, the solera system sounds like a good idea for whisky and would like to see other producers trying it! \n\nHowever the whisky itself is too sherried for my personal taste. \n\nReal shame about the added colouring too, keep it natural!","My favourite so far. Tried many over the last few months and this albeit sweeter than most of the whiskies I've sampled...is beautiful. I like the sweetness and oakiness that comes with this....next up...for my birthday...the 18 year old. Lush !","Very smooth, definitely the oak, sherry and dark fruit comes through. An enjoyable whisky..","Good beginner scotch.  Quite smooth with a light sweetness to it, though I could not make out any one flavor - fairly indistinct overall.  This doesn't make it bad, it just makes it simple and easy.","Top notch. Can really taste the sherry, still trying to pick out other flavours, enjoying it as well.","Wow! Awesome SM @ 15 YO. Rich and complex. Must try.","Being relatively new to whisky drinking last Christmas I got a gift pack with 12, 15 and 18-year-old bottles. Of all three I liked this one the best. I have a full (well half empty now!) on the go. From my limited experience I have to say this is a exceptional spirit, great aroma, smashing taste with a lovely finish as it goes down warming the cockles. Recommended.","Just a bit too Sherry like for me, but a decent drink.","I have tasted all 10 , 12 , 15 and 18 year old,  I have found 15 year old as the best . It has a unique rich taste.","Liquid gold, exceptional","Exquisite. Truly something to enjoy with others to mellow down. Very smooth. Best one I''ve had to date. Will soon get the 18yr and 21yr.","One of the nicest malts I have tasted in a long while. Bought a sample and will definitely be buying another bottle soon.","This whisky is truly one of the best malts around beautiful aromas and the taste is amazin,well done glenfiddich you have made a classic","The best","Best in the standard range,an fantastic whisky for the price.","Got a bottle of this from my folks as a birthday treat and it isn't letting me down at all. Bags of flavours and a nice long wood finish. Yes, you would be right, i'm no wordsmith on the tasting and nosing notes haha. The only downside is it's bottled at 40% which is a bit too low for me. I like to add a bit of water and it doesn't give you much room to manoeuvre. Great scotch though and will definitely get another.","Defiantly the best one out of the 3 standard malts, the 15 year old is smoother and has slightly more flavour than the 12 and 18 year old. 12 year is my second and 18 my third but I still drink all three.","I can highly recommend this whisky and understand why Jim Murray gave it 94.5pts. The complex treatment during the aging process involving bourbon, sherry and new American oak followed by finishing off in a solera is unique and shows through in the end product. With good depth and a fantastic long finish it's a steal at this price!","As I drink my first glass it is growing on me but I think that the glenlivet 15 is a whole lot better.","The first glass of the bottle smelled too strong to enjoy. But when I returned for more several days later, it was a different story. Smelled much more colorful then before. I will certainly rebuy.","This is one of the best 15 year old whiskies I have tasted (however, Glenfarclas 15 is better). This whisky has a very high quality-price ratio! If you are into complex sherry and honey flavored whiskies, this is the one.","Very smooth and enjoyable.","Very nice indeed.","A great achievement from the 12 year old version, so much worth the little extra money producer asks for. So much character in this one, possibly the best commercial single malt for the price. A must try.","I love this stuff. Thick, rich, smooth and full of personality - everything you want from a good malt. Better than the 18yo.\n\nIf you are looking to step up from the 12yo's to the 15yo's I would strongly recommend this malt.","very nice. I'm impressed. Going to buy another bottle and also the 14yo rich oak to compare.","It's not trying to be something that it isn't. But what it does, it does to perfection.","I remember the 15year solera reserve vats... that was the best 15yr and best glenfiddich ever made... def not the same as this but i still very much enjoy the sweetness just wish it had more oak and less honey to it","If you want peat, look elsewhere. If you want an incredibly diverse whisky, look elsewhere. The dram doesn't have heaps going on, this is true, but what it does have, to me, is brilliant. There isn't an off-putting thing about this whisky. You get honey, baked apple, cinnamon, oak, fudge, and malt. It's abv is 40% so don?t add more than one drop of water. It's not a complicated one but doesn't need to be.. this one just leaves you thinking what a perfectly simple dram.","(may contain spoilers)Wow, just wasted 30 quid on (has to be) the most over-rated 15y old malt of all-time ! Marzipan and vanilla. Should have bought a cake instead .. sigh .. that'l teach me, Highland Park next time.","This is really smooth and easy to drink, not my favorite but the best of the Glenfiddich range so makes it an ideal gift for those new to malts.","Decent, fruity  whisky , easy drinking . Sherry is obvious . A bit too sweet for me - I' d prefer the 12yo .","Very good whiskey, had bottles of the 12, 14, 18 year olds and the toasted oak reserve, this in my opinon is the best.","the 15 year old rocks. done the12 and the 18 year olds. of the 3 this for me is the best. this is the one to have on the shelf all the time.","Best Glenfiddich I've tried. In fact the only Glenfiddich I've found memorable. Beats the others I've tried at 12, 18 or 21 years old.","One of my favourite whisky?s, far better than Glenfiddich 12 and not much different to Glenfiddich 18, will definitely buy again for a special occasion.","My least favourite Glenfiddich, it tastes a bit smoky, like a poor version of an Island malt, and a bit thin to boot. Genuinely didn't enjoy it, although i did finish the bottle.","A fine jewel I enjoy alone. Lovely taste and after taste.Better than the 18year old in my opinion.","This is another bottle waiting to be enjoyed with only my very best friends who know a good dram when they taste one.","i love it!","A superbly balanced malt! Lush and fruity with a hint of bourbon. Not overdosed with a sherry flavour like many modern expressions. Good value and a superb malt for after dinner.","I've never liked Speysides... being an Islay fellow for the most part but this is quite spectacular stuff.. Very nice indeed.","I heard that this is actually the best Glenfiddich.","A remarkable achievement by Glenfiddich. The excellence of this whisky is due to its unique Solera process.  Its starts with a wonderful aroma which entices you to rush into the tasting which is head and shoulders beyond other Glenfiddich products in my opinion. A well rounded flavour with a nice hint of spice which enriches the flavour helping it to linger on the tongue. Delightful","A great whiskey for the price, a slightly peaty nose, nice honey and oak palate with spices, vanilla and spice finish. A well balanced dram perfect for sipping after dinner"],"139":["\nIf you like smoke, you'll like this. Tastes like licking a campfire, in a good way.\n","\nThis whisky is confusing to me. While one part of me hates the taste of burning rubber, the other half of me is drawn by the campfire smoke taste. Still I find myself pouring more just to experience it and to be honest I will be buying more.\n","\nI love this whisky!\n","\nI was very disappointed by this whisky.\n","\nThis is a very special whisky. Ardbeg or Lagavulin usually find their way into my daily glass, but every now and then I get a wild hair for Laphroaig. Every sip is a journey, an experience \u2013 something to be savored. I find just a few drops of water really help balance the flavours. The smoke is very intense, maybe the most of any readily available bottle, as is the peat, but the few drops of water work well to bring through all of the other sweet flavors that normally get overpowered by this malt's aggressiveness. There is so much more to this than just smoke and peat.\n","\nMagnificent smoky flavour. One of the best \u2013 10 star rating from me.\n","\nThis quality and taste on that price makes it some of the best value-for-money choices. Definitely worth tasting if you are into Islays.\n","\nI was dining one evening and on arrival I ordered a Lagavulin. The restaurant didn't carry it. After a few suggestions that fell very short, I had almost resolved to enjoy a Stella. Just then an attractive woman, alone at the bar, suggested Laphroaig (how noir, right? I couldnt resist) so I gave the nod.

It will become my go-to drink in the evening if Scotch is on my palate... and it usually is. There is no guessing with this beauty. You know exactly what you have and I love a smokey, peaty Scotch that isn't too sweet.

Instead I get soot, lots of soot, like I've had my head stuck up a chimney that's never been swept. Then there's peat, a whole peat-bog's worth. And a hint of salt and seaweed. My palate isn't refined enough to detect any sweetness but after a couple of sips the iodine that hits you on first sip recedes and the sooty aroma mellows to a gentle peaty smokiness. I close my eyes and can imagine I'm sitting in a wee croft in the middle of nowhere sitting by a cosy fire. I wasn't expecting to like Laphroaig but I do, and very much so. There wasn't any burn on the swallow, though I got a lovely alcohol kick that almost made me choke when I took too deep a breath after my first sip. After that I  made a point of breathing a bit more gently and it rounded things off and made everything more enjoyable. Long after the last drop went down I could still taste a faint smokiness on my tongue. A gorgeous drink, and one I'm going to take the time to get to know better.","Intense smoke, peat, earth, root beer, angle grinder blades,  salt, fruit \u2013 whisky deserving of respect. Love it or hate it, if there's one thing you have to do before you die, don't sky dive, don't cage dive with sharks, try this scotch!!! Whoever your maker is, I think he may wear a kilt.","This one opens with big, bold, ashy smoke riding on the shoulders of iodine. As it sits and oxidizes, the sweetness arrives to the the party bringing citrus and honey. No water added. This one is a pleasure.","Laphroaig 10 yr is the standard by which I judge all other whiskies. Intense smoke flavour that doesn't overwhelm your palate but instead creates a base on which all the fruit, brine, and honey flavours stand out all the more. This is not a harsh or heavy whisky, despite all the intense flavours it remains friendly and approachable. There is a reason so many people love this whisky, it's just that good, and at the price point it cannot be beaten.","I was shocked by this whisky, I was expecting this one to be challenging, perhaps even a bit tough to drink.\nInstead it was simply love at first sip, the flavor simply meshed with my palate easily, was surprised by how smooth the body was.  There wasn\u2019t a single thing offensive about the smoke and brine, instead it sort of blended with the malt sweetness to create a salted caramel like flavor with hints of fruit.","The layers are just mesmerizing. I could spend hours just smelling it. Its love at first sip.","After a trip to Scotland I fell in love with bold, peaty whiskeys and this is my favorite so far stateside. The nose is by far heavy medicinal, which I love, and the smoky peat. My palette isn\u2019t developed enough to pick up the  sweetness, but I am sold on the smoky, medicinal nose and the beautiful warm, lingering burn","Wow, started with green spot, moved on to Glenfiddich and then Bowmore. This certainly lives up to the hype, great lingering sweetness after the initial smoke and peat and leaves you wanting more and more.","The best Breakfast Scotch on planet Earth, and reasonably affordable ;)","My first was the 18yr and it was the dram that made me a whisky drinker. The first time I actually liked the stuff. Came to this one after the 18yr was no longer available. I taste the peat and idione the most.  Overall bold and smooth... and my favorite.","My first experience with Islay and boy what an experience it was. The nose opens with big smoke, immediately recognizeable to me as the scent of a classic BBQ, underneath you can find layers of salty seabreeze (VERY salty), iodine, a first aid box, and a slight hint of rubber. The palate also starts off with the smoke, though not nearly as huge as the nose, the medicinal notes really take hold afyer that, with seaweed dancing to the current of scotch rolling across your tongue, what is most surprising however is the bit of underlying sweetness, a light vanilla characteristic that serves as the only solice from a whisky that does NOT want to be your friend. The finish is long and warming, with a slight peppery bitterness. I'd also like to add that despite its strong flavor profile this dram is actually quite smooth as to it's mouthfeel and is by no means an unpleasant experience. Certainly not for everyone, but if you're in the mood for a more savory flavor profile as opposed the common sweetness that's found in most popular whiskys, this may just be dor you.","One of the best drams out there and for the price, it should be in everyone's liquor cabinet. The perfect mix of peat, smoke, a hint of salt & iodine all balanced to give you a beautiful sip at a very reasonable cost.","Like others, the smoke doesn't hit me as hard as some reviews describe. What I get is a briny sweetness. Peat, yes, but I just don't taste the campfire references. Perhaps it's because I drink this and other Islay scotch a lot. I've focused on some other Islays lately, Bowmore, Ardbeg, and Finlaggen (don't judge), Laphroiag is really a nicely balanced whisky. Don't let the \"smoke\" get in the way.","I disagree with people saying its not a beginners whisky: This is the whisky that got me into whisky! The distinct taste of peat, the note of seaweed and salt, the lingering taste of bonfire... It's all perfect!\nThe taste of smoke brings back memories of sitting around the campfire during my childhood and makes me strangely nostalgic. Truly, a whisky everyone should try! I don't give five stars lightly, but considering both the taste and the price this is one that's definitely worth it!","My mouth is watering just thinking about this badboy. The most delicious whiskey I have ever tasted in my life.","If you're like me and you enjoy seeing phrases like \"not for beginners,\" this scotch is perfect for you! Laphroiag is famously as bombastic in flavor and nose as they come, and your mind will be boggled at the extent of different flavors and smells you'll find. Obvious first of all is the wonderful campfire smell mixed with the briney seaside. On first sip, you'll be hit with brine and smoke, and even some medicinal, iodine-like flavor that is likely schocking to some. However, like any good scotch, the layers of flavor are peeled away as you get through the dram, and the smoke and salty waves give way to fruity sweetness by the end. It was a really fun experience to try Laphroiag for the first time. Give this excellent, challenging whisky a shot!","I just tried this at Whisky lounge fest in Newcastle and i was blown away by how nice it was...Nowhere near as smokey or briney as i'd been told.\nI love this whisky,and i think i could be on my way to buying one","Definitely polarizing but if you\u2019re one of God\u2019s chosen that enjoys it, it\u2019s the best thing you could ever hope to touch your tongue.","Rubbish. Promises so much on the nose and delivers nothing. Very disappointing. I'll stick with the Talisker","The absolute Daddy O.  Known for its Smokiness but it is so much more than that.  Smooth with a sweetness that balances the smoke and medicinalish taste.  A classic.","This taste like a campfire. Love it or hate it","This whisky is much more than just smoke. For some reason many reviewers keep emphasizing its smokiness when just about every flavour comes through. It is smoky, fruity and also maritime. You need to let it breathe for a while, add a tiny drop of water and enjoy.  The aftertaste is beautiful. Enjoy.","Dense, smoky and mildly sweet with a very distinct aroma.  A full bodied dram with character and personality you either love of hate it; personally, I can't get enough.  Triple Wood is king, though.","It is fairly well balanced but I get much more iodine flavor than the others. Not a relaxing whiskey but good at times.","Yes, Smokey!! \nI\u2019m still tasting the smoke now!","I\u2019ve been given this bottle for Christmas and I\u2019m no conosuere in any shape or form but all I could taste was Jayes fluid so I\u2019ve poured it down the sink . My conclusion is I\u2019m either very common or there\u2019s actually something wrong with that particular bottle or my relatives hate me . Has anybody got the answer to what seems like desifectant to me ??","Christ there is south smoke. After a few few sips I can taste the seaweed and salt. Slightly sweet with a lingering finish. Probably not a beginner whisky because of the smoke, but a great whisky to drink after finding you do like smoke.","I don't ever drink alcohol - but after sampling some Laphroaig (neat) the other day, I am going to order a shot from now on when I need to drink socially. I love smoke, and this drink is ALL smoke!\n\n- Hits smooth.\n- Smoke ramps up to a ridiculous level as it disperses on your palette and hits the back of your throat, tapers off smoothly into aftertaste over ~6 seconds.\n- Flavors as described in other reviews... definitely taste seaweed \/ iodine.\n- Minimal ethanol flavor, no aromatic ethanol burn.\n- All flavors blend smoothly throughout. No acidity, no nasal burn, no pucker.\n- Did I mention the smoke?","My go to. I always have it in my liquor cabinet","Ordered this at a local bar. Thought to myself, I like a bit of peat and smoke. It was served to me and the nose was complex and rich. Smoky, yes, but promising. And then I took my sip. I hated it. Many people associate with medicine, and I could see that. The smoke was overpowering and downright cruel. After a few minutes I took a sip. A few minutes later I took another. As I got used to the whisky, the whisky got used to me. My lesson would be, you can't just jump on this whisky. You have to let it creep up on you. treat it with respect, give it time to open up, don't expect it to be anything it's not. I kept coming back to it over and over, and by the time I was done it was like an old friend. I could taste it walking down the road home 20 minutes later. Even the finish seems to change, becoming richer, that lingering smoke almost chewy. \n\nThis is a fantastic whisky for it's price. It should be tried by everyone, loved by few, hated by some, but never leaving anyone undecided. Just give it a second, third and fourth chance and, who knows, it may change your mind. A poor man's Lagavulin 16, this makes a fine addition to any collection. You may find yourself coming back to it, even when you're not sure why.","Bought this yesterday after falling in love with Ardbeg 10 on the first dram a few days ago. This is even more intense than the Ardbeg with massive Smoke, peat and a strong medicinal flavour. I only discovered Islay Whisky very recently and can't believe it's taken me this long to try it.  Laphroaig 10 is absolutely not for the faint hearted or newcomers to single malt whisky but it's an absolutely wonderful dram.","Bought this scotch before reading tasting notes so my own fault, it is so heavily smoked as to be unpleasant. If you do not like smokey scotch buy something else.","Absolutely amazing. One of the best. I get toffee apples on the nose with iodine and pear. The taste is absolutely dreamy, like you're exhaling the seaside breeze beside a damp beach bonfire.\n\nI can't believe I left this whisky so late.  I will buy this again and again.","Wow just wow. The flavours are unbelievable Jeff. The peat plus sweetness. Glad I gave it a go. Looking forward to lighting the fire this winter and enjoying a dram or three.","Too smokey for me , I much prefer Macallan","Great stuff; the smell of medicine and smoke can remain in the empty glass for days.","Wonderful stuff. Under the big peat, brine and smoke, there's vanilla and pear.  There's also some nice mineral notes in here. Highly recommended.","GREAT whiskey. i love the smoky taste","lovely stuff,  Not my words Michael, the words of Shakin' Stevens!","Nice smokey whiskey! Surprisingly I didnt find it very intense as read in the reviews.","Massive smoke. This is like drinking a fruity campfire. It's a very good dram, but for my money, I rate it below a good Talisker 10 or Storm, or a Lagavulin. That said, I like to drink this on a cold night in northern Michigan. It's good stuff at a nice price. Bottled at 43% in the states.","I'm a huge fan of the Islay peated whisky's and this one in particular is fantastic. The nose is impressive on it, peat, wood, and a little hint of sea salt too it.  It's an extremely smooth drink, doesn't have the boozy-bitter taste that alot of younger whisky's have.  For the price its a must try, very similar in character to the Laphroaig Triple Wood.","I fall in love with this one at the first drop. It reminds me of the burnt soybean soup I've tasted in eastern China and it has an super attractive smell, which very close to the smell of motorcycle's machine oil. Very sweet, almost a simple syrup texture. Since this dram has such an outstanding taste, so it doesn't go well with soda or ice, but pretty good with tap water. This is what I would miss if I drink too many glasses of blended or Speyside malt whisky, a tough guy's drink.","Was introduced to Laphroaig 10 by a friend at a party. It was love at first sip. A big peaty kick in the backside followed by amazing complexity. Try a dram for starters as this is not for everyone; even the nose might scare some away.  On this note is is not a dram for the clandestine drinker as when it is poured everyone in the room will know you have.  Once the Laphroaigh bites you ,your hooked\n for life.","My favourite ... Started drinking this on a suggestion and now can't do without it","I drink it on the rocks and enjoy it's smooth full rich and smoky taste. My favorite scotch.","My favourite whisky. Peaty, smokey, and such a treat. To people saying it's like firewater you need to mix it with room temperature tap water to upwb up the phenolic flavours and subtle tastes within it. Don't drink it neat and don't put ice in. Don't put ice in any single malt. Finally if you mix this with Coke I will hunt you down. Enjoy.","As a first time islay drinker it was a revelation. The iodine smell trully makes a mark. An interesting dram for the adventourous ones.","This is a superb scotch ... the smokey tinge is amazing","Great whiskey. Love to set it on the table and wait till the smoke drifts up to my nose. Then taste the peat and smokiness together.  Have a bottle of Lore and Cask strength waiting to be opened. Also want to pick a bottle of Quarter cask. Never really liked Scotch much till I tried the Islay malts. Rich and bold. And Laphroaig a very good choice. Especially the Ten Year.","I used to love it as a go-to peaty and smoky single malt. It was ever so distinctive, oily almost with that nose of iodine \/ medicine \/ TCP \/ bandages. Judging by the bottle I bought yesterday, it seems this has been really dialled down, presumably to make it more marketable to a broader audience. It was super-smoked and seemed sweeter than in the past, an almost maple syrup or caramel in the aftertaste. The smoke and peat are obvious crowd pleasers, and, although a little too much so for my taste, the sweetness too. But those trademark iodine \/ bandages \/  medicinal notes and that oiliness which so polarised whisky lovers, and for me made it such a unique dram, seemed barely there. Still enjoyable, but a shadow of its former self. Disappointing and a real shame.","First reaction - What a fantastic nose! Enveloping the vicinity as well, and makes people take notice. Taste has very slight butteriness, smoke invades your mouth and proceeds to your nasal cavity as well, a dewy, smoky, slightly baked wood kind of a taste that lingers and lingers! Loved it! Will collect this bottle and recommend to others.","This is quite possibly my most favourite whiksy of all time.. it's a bottle I just keep coming back to. A huge punch of smoke on the palate, earthy peat, sweetness just to balance it off and a slight nuttiness too.. such a great dram for a great price! Brilliant stuff","Laphroaig  10 yo is still kicking and I'm little surprised. Today demand of Islay malts is so high that I thought Laphroaig would been ruined already for sake of volume. The Ten is still seriously underpowered and would benefit enormously if it would be bottled at 48 % like other distillery bottlings. Not to mention disbanding artificial colour and chill-filtering.","You know what you're getting with laphroig 10, sweet, peaty and slightly medicinal. If that's what you're into then you'll struggle to get better for the price although I think the quarter cask is comparable quality, if not slightly better and much the same price.","Wow if you like smoky flavored whiskey, this is your best choice. It literally seemed liked a fire was flaming in my glass. Unfortunately I'm not and would not purchase this.","I love the earthy flavors and smokey aroma from the peet. A lot of whiskeys get their flavor from the barrel. This is one of my favorites.","A fantastic deep whisky, so much character. Better than many much higher priced drams, only the Laphroaig 10 cask strength is better ( lots better )","I tend to buy Arbeg Ten more often since it's softer, more easy going, and slightly more balanced.   That being said this scotch is unmatched when you want your Islay malt's flavor and impact cranked to 11. Only a few other laphroaig expression can top it.  It's a very interesting, complex, delicious malt that two has a softer side if you give it time.","Nothing like it was a few years ago, still nice but not near as oily and flavoursome. Shame","A fantastic offering from Islay, bestowing a warm, peaty, smokeyness. Buy a bottle, drink it, feel the warm peatiness!!!","A mainstay of my growing collection... has lovely smokey and slightly acidic nose. Hits you with smoke and peat and stays for a long time! A genuine pleasure to drink.","The smoke will stay with you for a while. The perfect winter scotch.","Very addictive,  fall in love with laphroiag","One of the finest, a taste of the sea mixed with surprisingly reach flavor and smoke. Well goes with a good cigar. A truly remarkable addictive scotch.","Great taste. The smokines will make you addictive to alcohol.","Rich, oaky and full on peat. Different in style compared to Lagavulin and Ardbeg yet slightly lacking in character. Still very drinkable though. Lovely lingering finish.","Rich, smoky, and smooth. Don't ever drink this because you will never want to drink anything else. I love it.","At 1st sip I found it w\/an unusual  influential taste, touched w\/sweetness, however the lingering aftertaste of \"peatiness\" left on my palette was to earthy and pungent.","Colour: Gold.\nNose: Seaweed, iodine, peat, smoke, hints of earth and leather and smoked pork meat.\nPalate: Rich, massive smoke and peat slowly give way to brine, sweetness\nFinish: Long, mouthful of sweet smoke\n\nJust do yourself a favour, reach the shores of Islay and get a dram of this.","Top top dram...this is the one way street  to Islay.","Just heaven oily smoky with a hint of salt","Don't know why I like this but I do , nit my normal tipple  , very smokey and smooth with a slight antiseptic aroma  ,strange  but very  interesting  , will defiantly buy again","It tasted like a old burnt fishing ship, one of my first Scotches, and what made me fall in love with the Islays.","Definitely a dram for those with single malt experience.  Deep peatyness is not for the timid.  True to its billing.","From Scotland to Cape Breton Island this scotch is one of the finest, a taste of the sea mixed with the layers of peatiness and smoke.  A truly remarkable scotch!","This whisky is amazing you get a hit of smoke followed by sweetness, it's very addictive.","Salty and completely smoky.  It is an absolutely wonderful nose and flavor.  My favorite whisky hands down.  It tastes and smells like a campfire.  King of he peated whiskeys in my opinion.","Like drinking a campfire with lemons and a medicinal hint. Love it. If you like smoke, this is a must.","A really enjoyable product. Rich, full bodied, smooth, layered, pleasurable indeed.","Delicious. Full peaty, almost oily. The scotch that made me appreciate scotch.","First taste (before dinner) was awful, but I can foresee developing a taste for it.  Initially, it reminded me of a damp camp-fire taste,   but as I drank it a bit more--especially after dinner--I grew to like it more.  Still, a bit too smokey for my taste.","I just love scotch whisky and this is my all time favourite. Powerful, peaty with a lovely lingering taste. Any relatives who maybe reading this, you know what to buy me  each time my birthday comes around !!!    A fabulous whisky.....","Savagely peaty, amazing full body taste. You won't be bored trying this.  Every sip is a bombardment of flavours like some one set a peat bog on fire and put it out with water from the ocean.","My first Laphroaig whisky, I was hooked at first sip. I've always been fond of single malt whiskies but this one was perfect. Imagine my surprise when I opened up my household goods shipment from England only to find that my Laphroaig 10 year old, left for the movers, had been carefully packed and cushioned and sealed and sent back to Texas shipped wrapped in a mattress. These movers just knew a good thing and how much it meant to me. This was back in 2005. I've since enjoyed the 18 year old, Quart dr Cask and to date my favorite.... the Triple Wood. Great stufb.","what can I say, simply wonderful. A full body, lots of peaty smoke.  An easy choice when you want a whiskey that wont disappoint, the Select is a little disappointing, but the 10 year old is very good","Wasn't sure at first with the iodine flavours, but now half way through the bottle and this has quickly become my favourite dram. Prefer this to the quarter cask, and even the 18yo.","An excellent potion made of peat, smoke, brine and earth.","Very smokey and taste lingers on forever, still cant make my mind up if i like it or not.","Tastes like several pieces of charred hickory were brined in low grade mouthwash.  I guess if you are into that sort of taste, more power to you.  Medicinal smoke flavor lingers on your palate for ... well ... hours.","Like standing on the side of a peated embankment, the salt spray and fresh breeze caressing your face, campfires burning all refreshing. Refreshing, smoky, comforting, all in one dram. Perfect.","Wonderfully smokey, easy drinking scotch.","Laphroaig 10 year is a great scotch at a great price.  This is incredibly smoothe with a smokey taste that hangs in your mouth for hours.  I've even used splashes of it to add a smokey flavored to meat.  Tastes like a campfire in your mouth without the burn.","perfect, truly perfect. almost overpowering smoke, but like no other whiskey. truly unique.","I've been trying whiskey for years in the hope I'd develop a taste for it. Tried many, enjoyed none. Most were awful to my palate. Then I found this beauty, complete game changer. Now I understand what it's all about. This is the taste of the earth and the sea and the misty mountains all rolled into one. Perfection.","First single malt I was introduced to, spoiled my palate from all others","I have to say , I prefer the not so smokey taste. But I can tell you, I wouldn't be w\/o a bottle of this. I love the smell of the peat. It's a great scotch.","This is a whisky that can be a challenge from the first whiff upon opening the bottle. If you give it a chance...and you should...you will find it fully rewarding. One of the most unique a flavorful drams of whisky you will ever taste","Very smokey but not overwelming a very pleasant scotch.","Don't expect to like it, but know that it may suprise you. I prefer sweeter and smoother stuff, but fully enjoy this. Give it a go and if you like it you'll agree it's worth buying a bottle!","I can't say I'm well traveled so take this with a grain of salt, but I love it. Smokey, smooth, flavorful, delicious","Hav recently started getting into single malts as more used to blended. Have to say, after drinking this, it would be difficult to go back to a blended whisky.  This is superb, its now my favourite scotch. I think I'm in love!","Absolutely awful. I'm used to Glenlivet and MaCallan, but this experiment was like taking a taste of pure iodine. Really grossed me out and took awhile to get the taste out of my mouth.  Smelled and tasted like some industrial waste.","Perhaps not the best choice for my first attempt at a more peaty single malt from Islay.  I like the smokiness of it, but there is that back end which is like cough syrup which I just can't get past.  Perhaps as time goes on Ill develop a taste for it but for now it sits on the self untouched.","If you have never drunk whiskey and just want to try if you like it-do not buy this one. It is not for beginners. That's for sure. You will hate it, belive me. It has very strong smokey smell and taste. Its like you would put your head inside old chimney and took a mouthfull of sud. Once you pass that point it is actually nice but the taste will linger for a long time in your mouth. I keep it as a medicine drink for sorethroat.","Yes! Yes! Yes! One of the best if not \"the best\". Well maybe the triple wood is better!","Excellent","So, this was the third scotch I ever tasted and thought I was offensive. I vehemently avoided Islays ever since. Until 6months ago. Since then I have been collecting whisky from all corners all due to this diamond in the veritable rough!","Medicinal taste is not something I'm looking for in a Single Malt, actually not even in a rail whisky... If this is your thing, more power to you I'll leave a few extra kegs behind in my lifetime for you to enjoy.","excellent","My new favorite! Unbelievable smokey flavor.","maybe a little too smokey for my taste","one either loves it or hates it.\nbut if you want perfect example of what islay is, this is The bottle for you.\ni tasted quite a few, but when i first tasted this one i knew nothing will ever surprise me more.\nPERFECT","Good stuff. Smooth, smokey, hint of sea air, modest touch of peat-phenols. Genuinely lives up to it's producers notes, and a fucking bargain.","This is by far and away the best dram I have EVER tasted!  Smokey, luscious, with real body yet SMOOTH at the same time.  This wasn't my first Islay malt...Bowmore was my first, another good one...but this is definitely my favorite so far!  I enjoyed the 10-year old so much that I immediately went out and bought their QUARTER CASK version.  Can't wait to try it.","Imagine a primeval forest on fire, a massive moon towering over the inferno, the sparks surging towards the sky - now drink it. The aromatic smoke creeps out of the bottle like creeping black death, augmented by powerful peat and medicinal notes. The taste is surprisingly sweet for such an otherworldly (nether worldly?) liquid...I taste the notes of mango and citrus behind the fiery blasts of oily ash and burning tires. Swallowing it makes one second guess themselves as to whether it is poison or not - tons of ash, fire, burning forest, lit cigar and tangy peat course through the system, leaving a roaring bonfire in one's chest that lasts for several minutes. An unbelievable and unforgettable scotch. I've had Ardbeg, Lagavulin and Bowmore, and honestly, there's just nothing like this.","Always has been my favourite malt. I love the smokey taste and it's a drink I can sip at home and relax with or drink when out","Smokey and smells awesome.","Burning and charred hospital supplies including gauze,  tcp and plasters. Mix this around in a bucket of drying seaweed with old burnt tyres a jug of seawater and you start to get the picture. Add to the mix mouldy iced fruit cake,  butter, cream,  rum\/ raisin, a few pears and a little bacon. Finish with rusting iron railings, bracon, damp fresh cut cut hedge row, and sulpherous gases. Simmer slowly adding a lump of peat every hour and after a prelonged brewing we have a result! Remarkable effort yet to be surpassed in this original style...","Smells wonderful, great after a nice meal","They say don''t start with Islay single malts.\nI did anyway.\nThen I had the more popular Glenfiddich.\nI found it horrible and awkwardly sweet.\nLaphroaig is insane. Intense, delicious, complex and inspiring.","Laphraoig is the ultimate in single malt whisky and a drink unique in the world. Some may find its richness - for a single malt - and very distinct smoky taste a shock to the palate at first. It is certainly unlike the blended Scotches that most are familiar with, but you can''t consider yourself a serious Scotch drinker without at least having  tried it....!","I refuse to return to a bar that does not keep this in stock. A treat and a privilege, Laphroaig never disappoints with the bold and smoky peated flavour profile I have come to admire. From the start, this classic Islay offering is a truly masterful example of an expertly orchestrated symphony of deep, bold flavors. It hearkens to wisps of salty sea spray on bogs of iodine rich peat; gently crafted over a pronounced smoky richness which lingers on the palate long after the smooth, unapologetic finish.","My favourite of all the Malts that I have tried. The Oakley like smell, then the first taste followed by a really nice after taste.","Wow fantastic. I wish i could drink it all day long. The peaty taste is pure nectar.","For me...\"nice\" says it all.","Very peaty with a hint of salt. The medicinal nose combined with the sharp peat was very present. I had to add a drop of water as I thought it was a little sharp in the throat. If you are a fan of peated whiskies, this one will definitely blow your mind. However, if you drink this one daily, it might bore you eventually due to it''s strong character. But on a cold winters day, this one is great to have.","I recently tried the US\/Canada version of this (North America gets Laphroaig 10 at 43% ABV, not 40% like the UK). My first Islay scotch, and I can''t say I loved it, but it was good, and I am definitely interested in trying more Islays.","A classic which has been a fixture in my collection for a long while. Complex and muscular, it opens up beautifully with a dash of water.","A classic which has been a fixture in my collection for a long while. A complex and muscular, it opens up beautifully with a dash of water.","This whisky has a flavor profile like no other. Wonderful peat and complex flavors that I can''t even describe. Fantastic","at first I found this a little overpowering. It takes some time getting used too, especially if your used to the more popular speyside whiskeys. when I first opened the bottle, wow, peaty, It smelled as i would imagine a forest fire would smell like. at first sip, this wasn''t a favorite of mine, it was like I was tasting a band aid. After a few more sips, the smokey, peaty, leathery, sea salt started to become more enjoyable. i would definitely recommend this to those who enjoy complex Whiskey. I love it.","Unapologetically smoky and firey (with salty notes, like spray from the sea).\nImagine taking hot coals from the fire, dunking them in the sea and then shoving them in your mouth. \n\nNothing like it.","Absolutely no better scotch whiskey, period!","Fantastic medicine. This whisky is definitely one of my top favorites. Unique, powerful and storytelling. The smell and taste of the ocean is extremely persistent in this one. So much character. Godly.","Outstanding.The real celtic stuff.","Of all the Islay malts, I find this one to reign victor of the crown. Deep blue peat smoke enriched by medicinal oak, vanilla, and the lightness of fresh sea air. Its simple humility will grow on you fondly with a coinage that King Charles would extol.","Of all the Islay malts, I find this one to reign victor of the crown. Deep blue peat smokiness enriched by medicinal oak, vanilla, and the lightness of fresh sea air. Its simple humility will grow on you fondly with a coinage that King Charles would extol.","The aroma is nearly impossible to wade through...everyone at my table could smell it. And what a smell...medicinal, burning bandages and antiseptics, smoke. The taste is surprisingly sweet-ish though, and each sip leaves a comforting feeling of having a raging fireplace in one''s chest. The medicinal, first-aid kit on fire flavor lingers for hours after you''ve finished it. Not my thing at all, but I respect it.  I have no doubt that for Islay fans, it''s the ticket.","As a matter of fact rather than taste, Laphroaig 10 is inarguably the reigning champ of peated whiskies - particularly since the (alleged) decline of both Lagavulin 16 and Talisker 10. Ardbeg 10 competes but falls short. In other words, Laphroaig 10 is without a doubt the best whisky in the world. People complain about colouring and filtering, but I''d be very hesitant to change anything.","It smells of an old Band-Aid tin. Not a palatable omen of things to come. Going outside of the usual tasting cliches, I''ll call the flavor... odd. It tastes like whisky, but more... odd.","I came this whisky out of curiosity about islay malts, my normal choice being speyside whiskies I.e glenlivet. All I can say is wow, this certainly packs a punch and definitely isn''t for the faint of heart. I wasn''t sure if I could even finish my first glass, but by the second I''m hooked. Although I think this whisky is one you''ll either love or hate. Very very smoky, strong salty seaweed taste and the slightest hint of vanilla. I like a couple of ice cubes in mine, the water certainly brings the best out of this beast of whisky for me. Superb","Phenomenal! It doesn''t get better than Laphroaig","One of my favourites whiskies to-date. If, like me, you enjoy your winter walks then the Laphroaig 10yo should be in your flask. The smokey medicinal notes will certainly warm you up.","Good.","One of my favourite go-to smokey whiskey''s for a few years now, one company who has maintained an acceptable standard over the years. However, as ?37 is now the price I will not be buying it, it is not the retailers fault at all I will admit. In my native France it was 24 euros not all that long ago, here in London ?25 only 4 years ago. Thank you TWE for holding the price at this level, but this is not a premium whiskey and certainly worth the ?40 retailers are currently selling it for and i will not be buying it again until I see a ?10 reduction.","Can there be anything better in life than to sit at ones fireside with my old dog Camilla a glass of Laphroaig in hand and talk to my plants. The nearest I will get to feeling like a King. Charles W.","Exceptional taste, loved the earthy , smoky ,dry feel.Totally recommended","The Whisky was a gift to a colleague for fixing my computer.  He loved it.","Really nice","the malt changed my world, the earth taste, reminded me of days gone by, i can imagine drinking this and then inventing fire, or perhaps the wheel! amazing malt","Heard about its reputation before buying and it didn't disappoint. Massive peaty monster, although I have to say in my opinion it's not a whisky that can be nosed repeatedly over the course of a long evening, you will get fed up with the medicinal iodine smell!!","Imagine opening and sniffing a first aid kit whilst sat next to the smouldering remains of of a bonfire on the beach. That's what this is like. When I took my first sip I had doubts over whether I'd finish the glass let alone the bottle. Half way through the glass and I'm a convert. After a few neat sips I followed the distiller's advice and added a touch of water - it really opens it up and allows some subtle tropical fruit type flavours to the fore.","Subtle as a brick, I agree. But what a glorious brick it is!!!!!!!!!!","Sweet, medicinal and smoky Laphroaig signature. Lots of good qualities, but also seriously under powered and bit watered down too. Should bottled at least 46%.","This is an absolute classic. Sweetish yet dryish. Wild yet controlled. Robust yet elegant. The ideal drink on a cold wet autumn  or winter evening\/night with a fire, a beautiful woman and a wet dog...","Iodine, Peat smoke, and the halfway point between dry and sweet. A bargain. Be generous with the water.","The mesquite barbeque of scotches.  One of my favorites.","Laphroaig 10 Year Old is a single malt with lots of character. On top of everything that has already been said, it should certainly have been bottled at 46% like Talisker. Moreover, the fact that it is only 10 YO makes one constantly think that it is a bit premature while sipping this magnificent dram. 89\/100.","A very good and balanced standard Laphroaig with rich and complex smoky character. But I feel sorry to see whenever whisky is hiding it's full potential. What could this be with no color added, 46 vol and unchillfiltered? You get some idea with many Laphroaig indy bottlings.","It's probably just me, but I don't find Laphroaig 10 as overpowering as often claimed. It's certainly intense and not something I would want to drink more than one or two drams of, but it's not such a tough boys' drink as some people would have you believe. The nose has a lot of \"campfire smoke\", but on the palate it's rather the peat that dominates. The finish is impressively long.\n\nStill, I think Laph Quarter Cask is a bit more interesting and subtle.","islay whiskey - yes, its love or hate. absolute love here. islay forever.","This is the whisky for true Celts, you can savor the atmosphere of ancient bonfires, the wild celebration of a high blooded gathering\nrooted into the earth like weathered Oak tree that has been burnt over the centuries, this Whisky is the pure distillation of Scotland you hear the pipes wailing through the freezing mist-that's only after one glass!","Omg! smells and tastes of car tyres on fire \/ burning rubber \/ antiseptic cream.\r\n\r\nDid i finish the bottle? Well of course!","amazing whiskey, fully recommended","Got a bottle of this today as a gift, and wow, amazing stuff, one of the best tasting whiskys i've ever tasted, if not THE best, massive peat smoke right away which I love, that mellows away to a lovely smokey peppery finish which has to be the longest finish in any whisky I've had so far, lovely stuff, why didn't I discover this sooner?","One of my very favorites. If you love a peated-punch this is the best place\nto start.  The smokey flavor lasts throughout  and it has a nice finish as well. I must\nadmit that this is not a dram for the beginner but if you would like a nice introduction to the \nworld of peat this is it . Enjoy it's warmth on a cold day.","This was my introduction to Islay malts. My previous malts were Speysides. I had never understood how it might be possible that a whisky could tell a story in a sip. This one does. I have never been to Scotland, but; the story Laphroaig tells, is what I imagine it would be like. Standing around a very smoky peat fire, the spray from the ocean lightly salting you lips. Just a hint of sweetness. Excellent single malt that exceeds any blend.","i call this my sipping whisky it is special drink because i can \r\nonly afford now and then it has to last. I do not share it.\r\nAlan","Bloody fantastic!","this is top whiskey, same rank as Lagavulin...I like it.","Imagine sitting in the brush in a south Texas deer-blind in late December.  Hours of waiting in the chilled air.  Then it happens.....you bag that buck you've always wanted.  To celebrate the kill you and one of your buddies open a bottle of Laphroaig 10yr, pour it in styrofoam cups (glass makes too much noise) and enjoy it sitting around a oak and mesquite brushfire.....under the cold starry sky.  That my friends is Laphroaig!","Glorious rounded malt with a nice dose of woodsmoke that stays with you for ages. Really good but not for the faint of heart.","Subtle as a brick, just put a lump of coal in your mouth instead, it's cheaper....tastes like eating an ashtray.","Just having a dram evening. Had a singleton, followed by a highland park 12yo, which led me to a laphroaig 10 with stuffed olives and saint agur cheese.It just seems like a natural progression, you have a hint of smoke and peat and the laphroaig is sure to follow. My everyday fave is Tallisker 10 but it allways has to be followed by a laphroaig.Get some and drink it. You will come to love it, it's an age old phenomenom, every man loves a bonfire!","Now this one was a real leap in the dark for me. Reading here I knew it would be very different but decided to risk it. What a shock, this is a first class malt irrespective of price. Its mellow and has a fantastic smoky character that lingers for ages. So different to the commonplace malt taste. When I drink this bad boy I feel like a true blood Scot. It's seriously good and a refreshingly different!","Best everyday malt.  I love it.  Quality, affordability, and a decent distillery equals perfection.","My friend loves it, TCP a very good likeness if you put ice in TCP","Smokey with notes of sea salt. Characterful yes, but to be honest I found it to be a primal rather than a pleasurable experience.","Laphroaig was my first love, so it pains me to say that it's got too sweet and mild compared to the likes of Lagavulin and Ardbeg. Not a good sweetness either - kind of cloying, if you can say that about a peat monster. This is now relegated behind Lagavulin, Ardbeg and Caol Ila as far as Islay is concerned. The Quarter Cask is much better though.","TCP was my first thought... Then ..more Tcp.Your Palette will eventually get acclimatised .. But it will still taste like medicine.There a far finer experiences on the market for your money, and if you have the cash, blow it on a cast edition distillers cut.","Oily, peaty, medicinal, phenolic and... menthol? Not what I look for in a good whisky. I can see how this is a love-it-or-hate-it kind of dram. Not for me.","I love this malt. So rich and robust. The smoke, peat, brine, and other sea notes on the nose entice the palate. The sweet peat, smoke, caramel, kelp, pear?, and a hint of sea salt dance harmoniously on your tongue. The long, savory finnish leaves you craving more. A must have on for your whisky shelf. Long live the king of Islay.","My everyday drinking whisky......lovely, the smoke, the peat,...heaven","Well, this wee dram  is like marmite....some love it, some hate it! but you know what, i LOVE it, always have always will.it's really quite special.","Love it. Probably my favorite scotch. Only Lagavulin 16yr old comes close ...and thats considerably more expensive!","Fabulous Islay whisky, and a true classic. Smoke, toffee, caramel, more smoke - amazing.Also, at this price, probably the best value single malt on the market, and such quality too! Love it.","Got it for my 6oth Birthday.TCP spot on! Just as well I didn't pay for it.","I've just come back from Scotland and of the 3 whiskys I tried (the other 2 were Oban and Jura) this was the one I liked the best.","What can I say! Fantastic, a milestone of Scotch whiskey, the smell the taste is as if they had taken the soul of the island and were locked in a bottle. You can not say is good, not good, this is laproaig. If you do not like not ciriticate and try something else.","I know this is the most popular Islay but for the price it is hard to beat. Not to everyones taste but I love it. Sitting outside on a cool evening with a dram and a good large cigar. Nothing better.","I'm a Talisker man but this Laphroaig is a very close second. I love this intense smoke... My favourite Islay malt so far.","Not dissimilar to drinking neat TCP!Horrible!","Smokey,sweet with a touch of salt,like a bonfire on the sea shore.If you like smoke in your scotch then this drop is for you.Best enjoyed with company and a fuerte cigar.","Desde Espa?a. Uno de los mejores maltas que he probado. Sabor inteso, potente en nariz, gusto final largo, excelente. No a todo el mundo le gustar?. Realmente es como un trago de humo. Para saborear con un buen cigarro (puro)","This is a truly unique and much loved whisky - unlike the marketing driven sub par Laddie offerings released by the sales staff. Long live the king of malts Laphroaig!","Quite simply an exquisite Scotch Whiskey.  I am from America and currently in the military and have had share of spirits around the world.   I am stationed in Japan and my Romanian girlfirend introduced me to this smooth and aromatic scotch.  Laphroaig is so smooth and sweet I feel bad to splash water in it!  For V day I bought her the cask strength for us to enjoy and it tasted so good it's hard to look at another Whiskey the same.","Astonished to read above comment - Laphroaig themselves say people either love it or hate it.  I love it.  Other people may hate it, and that's fine too.  But whatever it is, it's certainly not indifferent.","This is just one more indifferent whisky... Buy something good instead - like the PC range from Laddie...","Disagree with above poster.  There's a Laphroaig for every occasion, and the 10yo definitely has its place for when you don't want the full-on strength of the QC or cask strength.  Love it.","Way too boring compared to the Cask Strength Edition and the Quarter Cask Edition.","peice of peatylicous perfection is a crime! My favourite Islay, It's a beautiful dram, bonfire, peaty, smoky, caramel, medicinal, delicious and distinguished!!","I didn't like this at first since I started my scotch journey with Balvenie double barrel which is sweeter and not as smoky but towards the end I started to really appreciate the smoke. It is now one of my favorites and I am looking forward to trying the 15 yr. I can also now appreciate the smoke in the Highland Park since tasting this one.","I am sitting here drinking this now and it is SO GOOD. Just looking around for a few other drams to swell the shelf with and something a bit different to juxtapose","Agree with the other reviews posted here. It is very peaty and therefore not for the faint-hearted. Not one to offer your guests who aren't sure about whisky. But if you like robust whiskies - this is great and robust and medicinal. Is there a better drink to put in your hip flask ? Possibly not apart from Green Chartreuse.","Absolutely fantastic dram! Great history and very proud to own a plot of Laphroaig land. You don't need to go camping anymore, just close your eyes and taste that peat smoke. Just be prepared to buy alot of it!!","Wow, smoky peaty brilliance. Theres not much more to say really. This is a top whisky!! A cold foggy night sitting by the fire drinking a drop of this wonderful whisky.","I am new to the single malts and have yet to find one that tops this I love the smokiness, have got my eye on a 15yo but it would have to be bloody good to top this","Smokey as a kipper and hits the chest like a fisherman's friend. Best enjoyed beside a log fire.","This is a brilliant smokey delight. The nose is strong and likened to a snuff box, the palate is strong, smokey and complex - with a distinct characteristic of pipe tobacco, and the after stays with you long after.  Waited a long time to try this and certainly worth the wait. A distinct whisky of the highest quality.","Ive got the cask strength one. This stuff puts hairs on your chest real quick lol. Massive smoke, Massive peat. Just what the doctor ordered. Pure medicine.","J'ai d?couvert il y a peu le whisky. Le seul, le vrai, celui d'Islay. Depuis je ne peu plus en boire d'autre. Le Laphroaig en est un des plus pur joyaux. Le paradis se trouverait-il sur cette ?le aux ar?mes de tourbe et de vents marins?","I didn't know that a whisky can so literally tell a story about the lives of northern hemisphere fishermen.  Nose: puffer engine room, medicine cabinet, leather.  Palate: SWEAT, kelp.  Finish: long and dry, forces its way to the sinuses and across the chest.  Aftertaste: like sucking on crab legs or chewing on octopus, except that it stays with you longer.","I bought the first bottle a couple of years ago and since then I have been hooked on the smoky, peaty flavor... I have tried the 10, 15 and Qtr Cask... all of them distinctly better than the other and all of them superb in their own league. Laphroaig nights are always special. Absolutely brilliant. My favorite dram.","persistence a must,rewards tenfold,one for the smokey peat lovers","My favourite Islay. Smoky, sweet, medicinal, delicious and distinguished.","a wonderful smokey peaty whiskey, lovely on its own or on ice, followed by olives","One of the smokiest whiskies i've tried and i love it! Definitely one to savour for any occasion.  Smell the peat, and enjoy the heat. A  recomended","Good stuff, smooth and rich. Some may not prefer the stronger peat and sea flavors in it, but certainly should be tried, to know this kind of single malt. Because of its distinct nature, some will love it, some will not.","Good enough for Detective Inspector John Rebus, good enough for me!","Smoky"],"140":["\nDelightful Speyside dram.

I was surprised by the thin, mellow character with only a subtle nose.  It is a good single malt no doubt but probably best for newcomers to the genre as others suggest.","I was given a bottle of Dufftown 12 year recently and it is my personal treat and thus only drunk by ME. It is absolutely lovely and  one will shortly be the subject of a gift for my son's big birthday who like me is also a SMWS member","Good start for beginners single Malt drinking","This is the Whiskey that got me hooked on drinking a mellow drop of Speyside. If you like your Islay's then this is not for you, but if you like mellow... oh yes, this is the one! The only problem I have is finding a supplier here in NZ for a reasonable price.","I had read quite a few positive reviews for this Scotch, and I love the price point, so I decided to give it a whirl. Maybe I've got a bottle from a bad batch, but my first impression was that it was a bit thin, in complicated, and generally lacking. That isn't to say it is bad, but it isn't 'good', simply 'ok'. It actually felt like a blend to me. Not a total loss, this bottle will be relegated to a 'house Scotch', assigned to the lower shelf with the likes of Grant's Family Reserve and Cutty Sark Prohibition (both of which I prefer to this), and offered to those less likely to know the difference.","A delightful single malt with some delicate flavours","Awesome impossible for me to fault! Apart from reaching the end of the bottle!","The best and pleasant texture","Wonderful","I love it and only wish it was available in British Columbia","I love it, my favourite Scotch. It has been delisted in LCBO stores in Ottawa. I dislike the controls that are put on our choices of liquor in Ontario.","Citrus smell. Explosion after a while.","Exceptionally rich for a Speyside, more like an islay without the smoke.","Best whisky ever","One of my favorites. Nice, sweet and smooth. Very suitable for people who want to explore single malts. The nutty sweet taste, combined with the oak casks give this whisky it''s unique nutty and a little spicy flavor.","Goes down beautifully .smooth  nutty taste .smooth \nPleasureable   to drink . No need for water lovely .\nJust tasted now a favourite","My most favorite scotch. Absolute delight.","It is toooo goooood !!!! The flavour, mmmmm.....the colour .....just perfect !! The taste ....smooth !!!","Wonderfully smooth and warm.","I guess I would be included within the so-called ''new-worlders''  camp. I am not a big whisky drinker, and not a lover of the smokey or peaty tasting whiskys. I found Singleton a favourite and have served it to several seasoned whisky drinkers. Evberyone enjoys its uncomplicated, sweat taste. A tiny splash of water brings the flavour forward.","Lies damn lies. This is a great spesysider. Citrusy, oily, a little wood and it''s the European kind not the recharred refill from Merkiuh. This is light, uncomplicated and wonderfully satisfying in the arrival. Its like your first kiss: eager, uncomplicated and guilty.  I would not recommend this for the Islay crowd. This is for lowlanders and New Worlders used to ice and sub zero temps. ;)","Far too much caramel in this one - it looks like Apple Tizer. Must be Diageo, eh? Nose is flat, arrival is best described as ''basin mould'' and the finish is overpoweringly glue. It looks, smells and tastes like cheap crap. There are far better 12 year olds. I can only attribute it''s high ratings among ''newcomers'' because it offers little complexity and is unpeated. Huge disappointment but then I have come to expect that from Diageo tbh. (without prejudice!).","The only problem with this malt is that once opened it won''t last long. The flavours in this malt are stunning,full of fruit with a long aftertaste.","Great!  Lots of fruit and nut here. Light and sweet. But if you''re looking for a heavy, complex dram, I''d probably look elsewhere. Liked the bottle too. My first single malt.","Fantastic and delicate warmth when the secondary taste comes into effect. You are in no doubt that this is a class act.","Would have been five star apart from the bottle. looks great but is a bad shape and dificult to poor.","My favourite in that price range by far, beautiful smoothness and do well balanced","Love this - Had a couple of bottles before and without any doubt will keep going back.. \nLike most men i just need to try the 18YO now ;)","A beautifully smooth and wonderful whisky, one of my favorites.","This has to be one of my favorite whiskys, reasonably priced and so smooth. A real pleasure to drink. Only problem with it is that it does not last long, once opened soon gone!","I purchased this item as a birthday present, it will be a very special occasion when it will be opened!","Dont need to spend more tis right up there wih the very best tasting malts very smooth","Fantastic whisky! Bought it as one of my annual Christmas whisky buys and wasn't let down whatsoever. Perfectly balanced, nutty and fruity.","Smooth, subtle & simply superb!!","I have a problem, I big one..With age I\u00b4ve been thru many bottles of whiskeys. I use to buy anCnoc Highland but now Singleton puts me between the haystacks. Cheers Singleton!","Easy going and very smooth and balanced. \nLow on smoke with some interesting flavours of young walnuts, wet hay, butterscotch, grape kernels and gomme arabic.\nMarvelous value for money.","In my opinion this whisky deserves the WWA 2012 award, it's a great young Speyside. I don't know how long ago it was relaunched but this surely can't be the same Singleton of Dufftown 12yr old that Jim Murray only gives 71 points in the 2013 Whisky Bible?","i just cannot get enough, am now nickmaned Singleton for people around me know that it remains a gift of choice to and from","simply BRILLIANT","This is a lovely smooth whisky, where for once the distillers description of the whisky is very accurate indeed. Dufftown has come a long way from an also ran to what is a really enjoyable dram.","I tried one a short while ago. It became my number one choice since then! Great taste, perfectly balanced.","Just purchased for xmasmbut had to have a sneaky taster tonight and wow . Very very impressive. Hope it lasts till the big day.","I wouldn't give this to a beginner - there are a lot of unusual flavours like grapefruit, grappa and walnut, plus it needs time to open-up. Beginners would probably just open the bottle and drink straight away.","the perfect whisky to introduce a novice to!","Great tasting scotch, one of the best","unikalno....the best...","Just got this bottle as a thanks for helping an old friend with his computer. Didn't opened it yet, but as I'm reading here I'm going to like it I think. I'll keep you posted.\n\nBottles up.\n\nCheers","Spotted this in a French Supermarket too.   Great dram and appreciated by our French friends to whom we have introduced it.","I was dubious at first, being a fan of Islay whiskies, but this milder and rather sweet whisky really caught my fancy. It has fine nose and tastes great, and I shall eagerly seek out another bottle.","wonderful speyside,had it as a present last wknd. it is smooth, sweet and wonderful.  left it in the tumbler for 15-20 min and it opened up gracefully with flavors and a caramel-ish nose.  thinking about getting the 15 once my 12yr is finished (shouldnt take long!)","I agree with above. My favorite Malt is Lagvulin but this dram along with Craggenmore and Glenfiddich are making me love Speyside and challenging my first love,Feb'12 Islay. Just very smoth and drinkable, not quiet as complex as Craggenmore but sweet on the pallet with a loverly long finish.","had a bottle given to me for christmas enjoyed it very much dec 2011 will be buying more.","very smooth had it on our last single malt whisky get2getha and all my friends as well njoyed it at least now m one step ahead of them to intro it to them had to fill my glass with a double evn if they star call me Captain Singles HA HA","Tried this single malt with much apprehension, however, the  soft nutty fruityness amid a smooth & lingering warmth combined to ensure a very fine evening dram.","A really approachable dram that has a smooth unchallenging but extremely pleasant taste. There are many more complex Speysiders and many more interesting but this one often gets pulled off the shelf as it so drinkable.","I am a malt whisky fan and drunk many types.Singleton is for me one of the most smooth malt a ever had. Since my first experience its my daily drink before dinner. What a drink!","Bought my first bottle in a French Supermarket this summer,now  wondering how i have missed this top quality Whisky for so many years!

Smooth, rich and sweet but not over-complex.  Aaahh!","I only drink Malt. Went to shop for Glenfiddich and left the store with 2 bottles of Singleton, went back for more. It is like honey on the tongue or like they say in Afrikaans \/ Dutch ' Moedersmelk' (Translation - milk from the mother)","Not bad. More interesting than the likes of Glenlivet or Glenfiddich but still a little on the bland side for my liking.","Very smooth. Sweeter with added spring water - to taste. For me it's two of water, one of whisky.","A client bought me a bottle as a token of appreciation after we won his labour matter, It is indeed a benchmark, my victorious celebrations are incomplete without it and so is my sad moments","My absolute favourite !!","Nothing I tasted before,  warm fruity approchable indeed","Being a Scotsman I've drank my fair share. This is a lovely introduction to single malt. Smooth and caramelly but not Glenmorangie sweet. The only downside is it's owned by those nasty Diageo people.","The first malt I tried was a talisker 6 years ago, and its strong peat flavour very nearly put me off for life. Singleton of Dufftown changed that! Accessible, smooth and with a rich fruit flavour of raisin and pomegranate. Any sweeter and this wouldn't be to my taste. Full marks to the maker.","Never mind all that pencil shavings and the nuts  nonsense. Just deep lovely whiskey with a lovely colour and worth twice the price. !!  Wonderful !!","Macallan 12 years Serry Oak Cast just by a nose","Not usually a whisky drinker, but this is fantastic! Really smooth. Lovely.","My husband tried it at the Goodwood Revival and bought a bottle there. Enjoyed it very much, hence a re order!","A fine tasting single malt, not reminiscent of anthing I've tasted before.  Reminded my of hints of fresh hay, green leaves and hazlenuts.  Not a trace of the usual peatyness found with other single malt's from this locale.  I shall definately be buying this one for Christmas.","Sampled at the NEC today a lovely smooth malt","Bought it on offer and I am glad I did. Easy drinking and very smooth, even my wife enjoys it and she usually dislikes the malts I buy.","Really like it","I love it.","Got myself a litre of this while on holiday and I would say this is marginally better than the similar tasting Glenfiddich","Bought this from the local Sainsbury's looking for a change from my usual favourite Talisker. I am not disappointed. This beauty of a malt keeps impressing me more with each glass. In my view it ranks alongside my other favourites Dalwhinnie and The Macallan. I will buy it again.","Picked it up at the duty free store at Schipol Amsterdam last week.  I was looking for a smooth before dinner single malt and I am truly satisfied.  The single malt to recommend for beginners.  But not available at home !?","Well, Peter and J Utting - your comments would suggest you weren't actually drinking Singleton but some nasty supermarket own-brand blended cooking whisky.  I have worked in a number of distilleries both in Speyside and the Western Isles and many distillers themselves regard this as a benchmark malt.  It is one of my personal favourites in this class, ranking alongside George","It's 'cooked' just right and the ingredients they use must be of excellent quality, tastes perfect for a whisky! Some hint of fresh green apples. I spilled a shot glass full on my desk once. I stared at the puddle in shock. It wafted this strong bourbon funk smell. Fortunately I had just cleaned the surface and you bet I lapped it up like a dog.","nice pretty smoth on second bottle yeah","A lovely little malt, right enough. A classic pre-dinner Speysider that has one of the most accessible flavour profiles of any Scotch I've tasted. This would be a fine introduction for the timid newbie.

I was convinced that this is a good whisky to \u2018start\u2019 with but in hindsight, if someone asked me for my humble and no-way-near-expert opinion I\u2019d personally rather pour them a Aberlour A\u2019bunah or a Glengoyne which still has an accessible roundness and interesting complexity and leaves nothing but a long lingering pleasantness.","Yes one of the best I\u2019ve ever had","This was the whiskey that really dragged me into the whiskey world. A brilliant whiskey and a personal favourite.","What sets aside  and makes Dalwinnei so special from other malts is the amazing  gentle first flavour followed by a cascade of  different after flavours and a degree of warmth which, whist  giving you a definite feel of strength, is  by no means  to sharp or harsh as to  leave  you with anything other than a lingering pleasant sweet after taste.  To me , there is no other malt or Speyside like  it. How can so many beautifully   aligned flavours come from such a pale hew scotch. Simply a delight made even better when taken from a chilled cut crystal glass, which when held to the light,  allows you to enjoy the colours even more.\nNo wonder then that my wife  presents me with a bottle on special  occasions.","I had never really been a drinker of straight liquor...mostly a beer and wine preference.  But as my wife and I happen to be about half-Scottish, we wanted to visit the homeland, so to speak.  In September we finally made it to Scotland, and one of the stops on our 6-day trip was to the Dalwhinnie distillery.  After the tour and taste-testing, we came home we three bottles: the 15 year classic, the Winter's Gold, and a Distiller's blend similar to the one offered for sale here.  They are fantastic!  My favorite is the Winter's Gold.  Put that baby in the fridge, and when ready to partake, pour it into a whiskey glass on top of a couple drops of water, and enjoy!  We want to go back and visit the region where the more smokey whiskies are distilled.","taste of honey without sweetness perfectly balanced with something authentic flavor and orange nutty taste superior whiskey for that price amazing","Excellent drop","Incredible whisky. Been tasting a lot lately and this one js a stand out. The tasting notes on here are pretty accurate I think but actually I spent most of my time loving the fact that I struggled to equate the flavour of this beauty with anything else. Its just a pleasure to drink; mouthfeel is lovely and smooth and coats every crevice of the mouth. Nose is wonderful and inviting. The taste carries you away like only the really special whiskies do. Not too powerful and full of sweet flavours. Delicious.","light, simple, great aroma and balance. ideal with just a few drops of water.","One of my top favourite single malt scotch","Great way to end your day.","Very smooth so much better than johnny walker","Beautifully smooth smokey underated classic.","A fantastic malt","After sampling the winters gold I really wasn't expecting much from the 15 but my goodness me What a surprise! Great whisky! lovely silly smooth, light and sweet.. lingering honey.. a very nice whiksy indeed!","Fruity and a bit of raisins on the nose. The taste is smooth but it's not my favourite one.","for a fruity whisky really great. im more of an smoke whisky drinker but this one suprices with an almost identical smell. on second hand you realise its something different. deffenitly one to try out!","? pleasure always","Light, fruity notes quite evident..","Very nice smooth whisky.  A complete change from what I normally drink & I will buy this again.","A lovely whisky","My favorite just add a drop of water","I'm surprised by many very high scores, and it seen as smooth. I was instantly struck by the strong alcohol taste and thin finish.","Fandamntastic","Call me crazy but there's really not much going on here. I'm not saying it's bad but just nothing special. It tastes like a slightly smoother Glenlivet or Glenfiddich. Those were the first single malts I ever had. Having only had blends or Irish and American whiskies prior they seemed great. Now stuff like that does nothing for me. If you want to try something in the light whisky style save some more and get a Glenmorangie 10yr original. It is much more unique than this","I want to update the last review. I don't think I was totally fair because I expected something different. To me it almost tastes coastal like Oban or Old Pulteney. I find that odd because I believe that this is the highest distillery in Scotland. Odd but not bad because those are two of my favorite whiskies. I like my second glass much more than my first so I would like to give it 4.5 stars now.","This is not a bad whisky and I'm sure some will love it. For my tastes there are more unique and better whiskies out there. It tastes like a mash up of Glenmorangie 10yr original and Old Pulteney 12 yr both of which I like way more than this. It tastes of salted caramel which is interesting. I live in nyc and most liquor stores here carry this as do many bars. There are much better malts that are harder to find here. I would have give it 3.5 stars if that were an option. Better than the most common malts, but not as good as many others I've had.","I find it to be harsh, acidic, and sharp without any real positives compared to other whiskies. It's not wholly unpleasant, but there are many, many better single malts for the same price.","wouldnt have picked this myself but have really enjoyed this bottle as it is very smooth and drinkable. Highly recommended","For the price I guess it's on the smooth side.  But after the bottle of Lagavulin 16, this is undoubtedly less smooth and more difficult to enjoy.  Maybe I'm too young but I strongly recommend Lagavulin over this one","My first bottle of DalW 15 as I wanted to try something on the lighter side.  Clean and crisp style, low smoke with wonderful balance of flavors, but not overly complex. Really nice balance at a reasonable price point.","Great","So far my favorite single malt. Very smooth and satisfying!","All that's good in a Speyside Malt","Along with Jura Origin, one of my favourites. I've enjoyed so many expressions; blends & single malts and there's few I don't like, but this is one I'll savour long and often.","Enjoyable nice and smooth","On the rocks for me! The honey is strong in this one, hits you like train, and that''s definitely not a bad thing!","Had this for the first time yesterday. A bit too light in body for me but not a bad drink. Sweet, slightly smokey,  a little fruity and very clean. Couple of drops of water help bring down the alcohol and reveal the flavours better with this one.  A very decent everyday whiskey.","Smooth,  mellow, very easy to drink","This one really needs a little water to take the edge of the harshness. But once this is done you get a fairly straight forward, no fuss, light and fruity tipple. Decent session whisky.","Very simple and subtle, perfect after a Sunday roast. Not a stand out single malt for me though. Would have scored 3.5 if scoring halves was an option. Bare in mind I''m a laphroig\/ardbeg drinker when considering my score.","wondefully balanced, a light and fruity malt with a great finish, perfect for when you want something not too smokey","Very lovely.  At first I thought a little dull.  But after a few days, or weeks,  it''s a very pleasant and relaxing dram","Beautiful. On the nose you could smell the honey and summer fruit. I did add a drop of water to it in order to reduce the sharpness in the throat. Very nice whisky.","One of my all time favourites. Fabulous nose heavy on vanilla with pear and apple.  Honeyed palate with more apple flowing into a sweet but spicy finish with a tiny hint of smoke. Lovely. A classic Highland Dram.","Wonderful heather and honey with touch of cinnamon - great value 15 year old - great dram","Enjoyable, but not amazing. Good value.","A light, heathery classic. I always have time for this Dalwhinnie.","Limited character, and despite the 15 years and 43%, rather thin tasting with a not-quite-balanced sweet-sharp pairing.","Beautiful subtle notes from this unique Spey malt, a definite must for the collection!\n\nPersonally... despite having grown up next to Benromach and Dallas Dhu distilleries in the heart of the Whiskey Trail, Dalwhinnie is my favourite!","a great bet for the price point. a subtle balance of sweetness and peat. delicious straight or with a small bit of spring water. what's not to like?","Definatly underated. I think it is very well made and there is nothing not to like about it. If you are looking for a kick of strong peat then go elswhere. I would strongly recomend this to anyone, its quality just shines through.At 15 years old and 43% its spot on.","Dalwhinnie is a subtle, well-balanced, elegant yet bland and somewhat unambitious dram. If these notes are also part of your tasting notes of this dram, then you got it, this is what Dalwhinnie 15 is about. It is one of the most approachable and easily drinkable dram ever, do NOT expect to be overwhelmed by it because you won't be. Good and dependable everyday dram for the money.","I prefer to drink it than talk about it.","15 years of age and 43% are a much better starting point than most standard malts. Dalwhinnie is a pleasant and approachable medium weight highlander. Delicate and delicious with light honeyed fruit. A very enjoyably drink that is often overlooked and underrated.","An excellent whiskey that is very sweet and easy to drink. Perfect for starting of with, before moving on to heavier, smokier stuff","Sniffly on the nose, leading to a pork pie on the way down and a hint of cheese and pickle sandwich on the finish. All in all a very nice picnic.","Starts out with a bite then smooths into a symphony of sweet smooth fruity complexity, then finishes with a woody note of fruit. As good as anything twice the price.","Smooth as milk! Fantastic pre-dinner dram also, at least I find it so! After dinner I prefer heavier staff - Laphroaig, Lagavulin or similar, instead of cognac.","Very smooth... too smooth? Maybe...","tried this for the first time at a wedding on saturday found it really nice have found other malts way to peaty for my pallet will be buying some for home","With its initial smooth honey notes and vanilla after taste this is certainly one of the easiest whiskey's to drink I have  encountered. Deffinately going to purchase another bottle as soon as I can. I recommend adding a teaspoon of water which seems to break the surface tension of this 43% proof whiskey.","This is one of my all time favourites... just so easy to drink.. help relax the body and mind after a long day at work...","Love the comment concerning the spelling of previous reviewers, classic telegraph readership response. Anyhow I'm in no way a whisky drinker as read the guardian but in my humble opinion a very very enjoyable drink. Ignores the ridiculous overpowering smokey tastes favoured by the masses and focuses on a delicate balance of subtle sweet heather sweetness with a hint of liquorice.","I agree with Jamie H's analysis - I was rather underwhelmed by it too, and I expected more from a 15-year-old.  Perhaps the description 'medium-bodied' should've clued me in to the fact that it wasn't going to be overabounding with rich flavour.  Subtle and sharp could be the two most applicable adjectives, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.","Got to be honest, I had a bottle over Christmas and was a little underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, it's still a great malt - sweet and easy to drink. But for the age and price I was expecting more. I would only buy it again if it was on a special offer. Glenfiddich and Glenlivet 15yo's are a much better option.","Second best single malt iv had 9\/10 good stuff","First bite is little bit ...., but second and after than you can feel to smooth and little bit smoke, warm, honey  ..ext  and what can I say It's Awesome","A very grown-up whisky this one, beware, sharp to begin with, but after a few glasses settles into a lovely if slightly harsh woodiness. Quite a nostalgic drop for me, reminds me of the time as a little kid trying my uncle's whisky, and getting blown away by the potency of flavour! Who's knows what that was, but this certainly takes me back ...","This is whisky for the senses and for the sweet-tooths; decadent & luxurious.  The faint peat on the finish guarantees that it never becomes too sickly.  Exquisite stuff.","very bloody good best 15 year old i tasted","Very nice indeed. Leaves a lovely smokey toffee aftertaste.","Intensely flavored with quite a sharp edge, will certainly warm up a winters night. Long finish with a background hint of smoke. A good malt but not one I'll be returning to.","This is a bit of a puzzle this one - it is very light on aroma, not even the 43% alcohol is evident. But where does all that taste come from? - Complex with very sweet honeys and a lingering toffee. A good whisky","Utterly superb. Smooth, complex, fruity, tangy, spicy, warming. My favourite unpeated single malt right now.","I was a little disappointed with this, being new to whisky drinking and was looking for a easy drinking whisky. While this is fairly good whiskey I find it is harder to drink than the double wood Balvenie, or even Jack Daniels. I will keep at it and see if my tastes change.","tonight i was looking for sweet whiskey so i opted for this , although it was not what i thought at first it sure is worth every penny very smooth and not rough or unpleasent ,","this is possibly the smoothest whisky i have tried, initially tastes sweet, but has a lovely complex flavour and smooth warm finish. I've tried loads of malts and this is up there with best of them :-)","I had a haggis tonight,what a lovely drink to complete the meal.So smooth and mellow.What an experience.Johnnie Elliott.Jan 11.","Very smooth and a little complex though I find it a tad boring","What  really worries me is the grammar and spelling of some of the reviewers! If they can't get those right then I don't think that their reviews are valid.","Very,VERY nice indeed with the longest 'finish' of any malt I have tasted. A definate 'must have' for any whisky enthusiast","Drinking this is like eating dessert! I had my date taste it even though I knew she wasn't fond of whisky, and even she was impressed. From tasting it first in Buchanan's blend and then having the single malt it was a full flavored, one-of-a-kind, outstanding whisky.","Dalwhinnie was the dram recommended (by a hotel bar person) to go with the evening meal of haggis. I'd never tried either and now enjoy both. As has been said already, it is oh-so-easy to drink, with flavours enough to delight the palette but none of the burn as it goes down. Every glass is a treat.","It is nearly too smooth! But the second time I tasted it I noticed a pleasant complexity. Very nice whisky indeed.","Beautiful whisky, up there with 18 yo glenfiddich, sweet and dangerously easy to drink. Would love to try some of the older versions.","iwill always remember my hoiday toCallander it took the barman 10 days before he found this most delightful malt.This malt stands far above all others malts it makes you glow from the middle outwards.Fantastic.","Nose (undiluted)Lemon, orange rind, and pomegranate.Palate (undiluted)Smooth entry of honey, some peat, cocoa, a little milk chocolate and malty flavors that shine through at the mid-palate. My initial impression is that this is a sweet whisky. Makes for a great after dinner drink. Maybe with a dessert.","Well, i have only tried a handful of single malts including cragganmore, jura, glenfiddich and talisker but this dalwhinnie, wow, i want more.","You really can't go wrong with this malt. It is clean, subtle and oh so smooth. A fairly gentle dram at 43% vol but never lets you down. If you ever get the chance do visit the distillery. The highest in Scotland but very close to the main road through the Highlands.","i to thought it was similer to glenfiddich 15year old i  brought another bottle","A very simple malt that is smooth on the palette and gentle to taste. A very good Whisky to drink regularly and a good introduction to whisky. You will not be disappointed with this whisky.","Simply put a fantastic malt whiskey.Super smooth and gentle on the throat.  It is my favourite whiskey for giving to guests new to the malt whiskey experience.Just buy it and never regret it.","Smooth and honeyed certainly. But it took the whole bottle before I found the  advertised smoke in the finish, it's very light.","The whisky I was looking for. Easy drinking classic.","If you thought James Bond was smooth then you'd better take a seat. Dalwhinnie is without a single edge, crack or bump. If it were a motorway then your car would simply slide along to its destination and if your destination is 'pleasure town' then Dalwhinnie will get you there fast. Relax and Enjoy.","Light and delicate but also quite complex. A good all-rounder.","this is a fine whisky one of my favourites","Reminiscent of Glenfiddich, in that it's subtle, but there's a complexity there that is out of this world, minus the nasty apple taste. Not as smokey or full bodied as Lagavulin (my personal favourite), but has its own character and more for the Glenfiddich crowd who just won 50 bucks at bingo and are looking for something a bit higher end.","agreed.  this is a fine and subtle whisky with a notable strawberry nose.  silky smooth in the throat too.  the glenfiddich 15 year actually burns-this one....does not","You can't go wrong with this whisky,it is easy on the palate and goes down easily,has a robust flavour.....mmmmmmmm."],"144":["\nI got to this North Star malt via Ralfy and I haven\u2019t been disappointed at all.

Interesting experience indeed. I cannot distinguish a full range of the nose, taste or subtleties of this whisky but I am enjoying it. It does have a sweetness to it but it also has a crispness, or boldness... sort of a yin and yang if you will. A pleasant sipping experience indeed.","High viscosity. Oily coatline and slow Legs.\nNose - heavily Sherried, very sweet, caramelised sugars, dried fruit, honey, slight orange, a little spicey. Left to air for 30 mins or more, cereal gets stronger.\nPalate - sweet, sugary, sherry, fruity, orange marmalade, honey.\nFinish - medium, fruity, spicey.","This is a delicious highland whisky that's fully matured and not just finished in sherry casks. My only complaint is that it's not more available in the US. On the nose it's sweet and dense like maple syrup. On the palate rich,full bodied and smooth with plenty of fruity sherried sweetness. The finish is long and warming with plenty of sherried fruit and just enough spice for balance. Delicious stuff that should be easier to find.","I love this ! I agree with Mike in that I also like a sherried finish. There is a sweetness  mixed with fruit and toffee with a very clean and moreish taste.\n\nI risked this and am so glad I did!\n\nOnce finished I will get another one.....","This is my goto dram, almost all the time. I love sherried finish. So much so that I'm almost done my second bottle of the year. And its not too bad at $50.00 CAD.","Having tried the 15 year old previously!  I succumbed to the temptation of a Dram of 12 year old Glenrothes. I was pleasantly surprised and impressed with the depth of flavours and also smoothness. The spiced fruitiness of raisins coupled by a late toffee and citrus lingering on the tongue made it a pleasure to sample.","Really tasty scotch with plenty of flavour, if not that subtle. Gives you the flavours of a sherry cask but is still clearly a highland. It is a bit dry on the finish for me but still great value for money.","Nose - Grapes and pears with Granny Smith sourness of apples. A whiff or demerara sugar. Palate - vanilla and sharp apple balanced by sweetness. Perhaps a little thin on mouthfeel. Finish - spicecand toffee with a hint of dryness.\n\nOverall not a bad dram if perhaps a little thin. Doesn't have the 'chewy' finish of some other Highlander or Speysiders. A decent dram though.","Disappointing...I had read and heard about this one for a while as being excellent. Being a fan of Dalmore, I had heard that this one was even better. Unfortunately, Glendronach 12 turned out to be rather a humdrum affair, tasting more like a slightly sherried Speysider than a rich Highland malt. I did get a lot of grapes on the nose and in the taste, but found the woody notes overwhelming, and the dryness off-putting. Dalmore 12 is a far richer, silkier scotch with a much more memorable flavour. I know Dalmore has its haters, and Glendronach seems to have the majority vote as one of the best, but I'll take Dalmore any day over this.","On the nose, this one reminds me of burning orange zest (as they do for some cocktails). A really impressive bold sherry taste, nice and sweet. This is a good staple for any whisky collection.","This whisky is just like a delicious dessert. Rich, fruity and sweet.","A proper traditional whisky. Well made and good quality.","When you find what you like, why look further ?","Really good sherry cask whisky, and comparing prices with other similar drams, good value for 12yo, 43%, unchillfiltered and natural colour.  Yes, the 15 and 18 are better, but with this whisky, you do get what you pay for and this is well worth the money.","The descriptions on the box make it sound way better than it is. Its good, but i expected more. Im on my second bottle, since so many positive reviews I'd thought i give it another chance so I got another bottle. It disappoints again. I mean its not bad, if you want a medium bodied sherry scotch for the price, this is probably the best you''re gonna get. Personally, I like the macallan 12 better, its richer and has more body. If you can get that, get it instead. \r\n\r\nOverall: Its a good sherried dram, but i was expecting more. The nose is sweet, and you''d think the palate is going to carry what the nose is telling you. Its just on the palate its not that thick and creamy like the notes that are on the box what woud lead you to believe. \r\n\r\nI probably wouldn''t buy another bottle, If you want something easy drinking thats sherried get the Macallan 12. If you want something like this but sweeter and heavier get the glenflarclas 105","For a single malt 12 years old!!! Simply the best","My favourite whiskey","What a lovely drop!  Heavy sherry beauty product with fantastic dark berries flavor and aftertaste all the way.\nFrom the first sniff till the last after taste drop.

Son of friends attending University of Edinburgh brought a bottle back to New York as a Christmas present. This has become an annual gift.

Its a nice story anyway and a lovely drop!!\n21st October 2014","In a class of its own","GD12 is the very best money can buy at this range. At entry level malt, GD12 far out-distances all other sherry-Speysiders. Yup, best-bang-for you-buck kinda thing. MY DAILY DRAM. (Pls don't raise the price).","It starts with a nice nose, sherry richness coming through with biscuit and cake aromas.  Good balance of matltiness, nuttiness, Oak, some spices and berry fruits.  The finish is bitter chocolate and dry, but a good entry level Glendronach and a good drinking experience.","Beautiful stuff","A lovely sherried Speysider, almost a 'sherry-monster', and very well priced too. What's not to love?!","A heavy, chewy, Christmas pudding of a whisky: simply delicious. Very similar to Glenfarclas 15yr old, but at 3\/4 the price, and arguably better. This is not a subtle dram: it's a big hitter: this is the Big Peat of sherry whiskies.","Rico: We've tried to get some Octarine but it was a French exclusive that only a few other stores managed to get a few bottles of.","And how about the 8yo edition, ie. The Octarine? i heard it had 46% and was non-chill filtered - I saw it in Italy, Spain and Poland.","Breathe it in to get light creamy vanilla, sherry, a few toffee notes and fruit cake. On the palate is strong sherry, sweet spice, autumn fruit (blackberries) with a bit of warmth. I find the finish to be very, very short on this whisky though, so don\u2019t expect it to be dense and heavy, you\u2019ll finish your glass quickly (may or may not be a bad thing!?!).","Our tasting group rated this offering one of the most complex yet accessable and easy to drink","Absoloutely superb neat however the 15 year old is even smoother and well worth the extra 20 pounds","From a simpler time, when slighty burnt raisin fairy cakes where order of the day at the school fate.","The nose is very sherried and foreshadows what awaits on the palate.  Once you taste, you will discover it is quite sherried. Lightly spiced. Rich, sweet, red fruits like strawberries and red currants. Very light peat. Medium bodied.  Some somewhat dry sherry, raisins and cloves linger a decent amount of time. Finally, there is a zing of burnt toast with strawberry jam and some rasberries. Oak is there too.  Very good value for money.","The new version is much better than the older one. A little acidity(lemon)and quite some maltiness with some sherryness, quite powerfull and a long finish. IT's less powerfull than the 15 and 18 year old but it is also quite different. More easy drinkable also.","This was my introduction to single malts. Rich and full-bodied. Good value too.","I recently (MAY 07) purchase a bottle duty free and what initially attracted me was the darker colour than that of other malts id previously tried.  For me the big stand out was the subtle toffee flavours and the price, in my opinion it drinks in a higher price bracket.  I also found it was complimented with a nice Cuban cigar which introduced a rich earthy flavour.

That means that Glengoyne is distilled in the highlands and matured in the lowlands. As far as the whisky goes in my opinion on the nose it reminds me more of a light speyside than a rich highland. It is light and floral with hints of sweet nutty malt. On the palate there is nuts and fruits. There is a great whisky blog called scotchnoob.com where the writer described this as peanut butter and jelly in a glass. I never would have thought about that myself but is a perfect description. Floral with nutty malt and fruit. Tasty. The finish is of medium length, sweet with slight spice. Very good stuff that is worlds better than the more well known malts in this lighter style. I recommend it\n","\nHaving tried several single malts, and having always space for any of them, there are always some of those that emerges in our list of preferences for its quality on the palate. As I have commented in arran 14 item on TWE, this Glengoyne 12, being only a bit less complex, in my opinion, is a refined whisky on the palate, without lacks in savour, and continuing delivery the malt flavor that I love, not being submerged by other flavours. Very good single malt indeed, one of the best scotish single malts I have tried until now togheter with his brother Glengoyne 18 and Arran 14, and Glendronach12&18. Note that this whisky, as Arran, don\u2019t have artificial colour (ARRAN 14 is a non chill-filtered too)\n","\nGreat beautiful gentle whiskey, enough said!\n","\nA gift from family who took a tour of the distillery. A superb easy-drinking dram in the dessert style.\nToffee nose, floral notes develop if left for 30 mins or so.\nThe palate is a nice malt hit of toffee, Horlicks and Werthers Original.\nAgain plenty of sweetness on the finish, perfect following a hearty meal.\nA little post script, the website states that E150 is used yet the distillery tour made a point of stating the colour is entirely natural.\n"],"149":null,"150":null,"151":null,"152":null,"153":["\n Excellent, rich yet clear and balanced\n","\nI bought a bottle in Edinburgh last year and the licorice notes are the gamechanger.

Even though a lot of people compare this to Islay whisky, it really reminds me more of Talisker. It has a mineral, rocky and medicinal character. Mull is north of Islay and south of Skye.

I never got beyond Edradour for I saw no reason to move on; I had found my perfect malt. There is something in the aftertaste, velvety and reminiscent of a famous whiskey liquor. Although I often get given other malts (many thanks to all), this is the only one I now buy myself - oh, that is apart from the Natural Cask Strength version for those special occasions.","Lovely smooth drink","Nice and interesting . Pleasant change","Sherry bomb!   This is very different from any malt you will ever have.  The interesting thing is that the longer it sits in the glass, the more it seems to open up.  Let it rest for 10 minutes before the first sip, then take 2-4 mins between subsequent sips.  On the nose there is sherry and more sherry.  Sweet dried fruit mixes with something more savory, almost fungal.  This a damp forest after the rain has ended.  There is faint butter and something almost like beef stew in the distance.  On the palate sherry.  Sweet fruit with a smooth buttery mouthfeel.  Maple syrup and butter like a pancake breakfast.  The finish is long.   It starts out like the palate, but then the spice kicks in.    Something like spice cake with chocolate frosting in a glass.  Delicious and unique.  I like every malt I drink to taste like nothing else and this does not disappoint.  Glendronach 12 has always been my favorite malt for full on sherry.  I would love to taste it head to head with this.","The best Whisky from the smallest distillery in Scotland","smooth taste. \nvery smooth with\ncaramel and fudge after taste","Smooth, delicate and pleasing to the palate","Great flavor!","Excellent,refined taste,like a velvet in mouth but strong.Congratulations!","Ultra smooth.

Vanilla.\nPalate - sweet, orange, spicey.\nFinish - estery, sweet, orange, chocolate. \nTypical Speyside with short fermentation and I suspect very very narrow cuts with lower cut in the high 60s percentage ABV. Reasonable for the price, but nothing too special.","Legs, slow, oily.\nNose - sweet, estery, citrus, ,  marmalade, strong dark chocolate is one of the first aromas,  subsides after ten minutes, malt, spicy, green apple, reflecting a short fermentation. Some dark fruits. \nPalate - sweet, citrus, orange, marmalade, slight green apple, spicy. Plenty of body, oily from cask and short fermentation.

I sense some whiskys older than 15 years old have been used in this too. I used to really enjoy the Dalwhinnie 15 year old, with its delicate honey and lime zest. This one completely obliterates the delicate touch of what I had come to regard as the Dalwhinnie character. I had thought the whole point of Dalwhinnie was to avoid heavy rich flavours, to retain that lightness of touch.  I read a review which said if you like Clynelish, you will like this. It is certainly bordering on Clynelish or maybe more Old Pulteney 17 year old. It really isn't bad whisky, there is none of that cheap sweetness that you can associate with 'modern oak', it is still a classy product but for me, 'Dalwhinnie it ain't'.

The word 'unfinished' springs straight to mind, lots of flavours I expected but just not really tied together yet. Would like to try the 12yr old and see the difference a little time makes.","I thought it was the most awful whiskey i've ever tasted!","Those folk at Bowmore are very clever. How can a strong peat character also evoke the finest of artisan confectionaries? Sweet, rich, fudgey and fruity... but it's still peat?! It's possible. Bargain basement Bowmore, but blooming brilliant.","Not as smoky as other versions I have come across but does still have most of the signature Bowrore taste.","I just love this scotch , the peaty, smokey and saltyness of it is something to get you in.A touch of honey and spice run across the tongue also.Very,very good and a must have in the bar."],"168":null,"169":["\nThis is a full flavoured treat.

It was 100% worth it.","Relatively new to the world of single malts, and this is my first drop of any of Talisker's offerings. It packs quite a punch for me personally so I drink it with a drop of water, but after a few sips, you get used to it, and it sort of mellows out a bit and you can begin to detect the sweeter, creamier notes followed by a peppery bite and a peaty finish. I am actually quite partial to peated single malts (which is unusual for a 33 year old lass, or so I am told!) having enjoyed several bottles of Laphroaig, but I think that as a fan of Aberlour and Glenfiddich varieties the Talisker Storm is just a tad too peppery for my palate.","One of the best deals for island scotch, it's of surprising flavour and complexity for a NAS whisky. In terms of how it tastes, it's pretty much what is says: Taliker's NAS whisky with some extra kick.  I have had far more expensive scotchs which had far inferior taste. If you like island whiskeys definitely give this one a try.","I've tried several varieties of whiskey over the last several years.  A majority of them I will buy again.  This will definitely not be one of them.","You know, I'm not the person who judges single malts or any fine spirit by its taste. It's where it brings you that is important and how it leaves you in the morning without any lingering side effects.  I truely believe that Storm reached a certain untouched, virgin if you will, part of my cortex that just sent me above my body and into a zone I never visited. That was with only with two ozs. and a splash of branch. You won't need more. What a delightful gift from my older brother on my 68th birthday. This my friends is absolutely the best Scotch whiskey on the planet!!  Enjoy.","Varies by the batch.  I've had quite good Storm that is like the mother-brand except a little sharper to the palate.  And I've had stingy Storm - like the one I'm sipping now - that might have a better use as antiseptic.","1st time... birthday gift from my son...smoky peaty goodness with a smooth spicy finish that lasts","This is the malt that got me started into peated scotch, and it remains right up there in my top 5 whiskys. A wonderful play off between fruit (mainly orange), peppery spice, and the renowned Talisker smoke and peat. An excellent dram.",":-)","The sweet, creamy fragrance like bananas and honey throughout the glass really adds a delightful layer to this dram. The palate is slightly lacking(compared to the complexity of the fragrance) and the roughness of young whiskeys cannot be completely masked. Palate-wise I prefer the Laphroig 10, but overall a good dram","A Talisker Storm is a rare weather phenomenon where 3 year old whisky feels like lightning when it hits your tongue","superb warm tasting dram","Having travelled much of Scotland tasting various different malts on my travels this certainly ranks in the top 3. It is my go to purchase in the shop when buying for myself or as a gift to a friend. Ignore the lack of aging, massively out-performs it's price.","Thinking mans drink ! Ace card.","On holiday on SKYE , visited the distillery not to be missed , sublime everything in a dram you could want","Reminds me of Glenlivet 18 on a slightly lighter note. I was wary of no year on the bottle but so glad I tried it.","Awesome...  this is one the best ( top 3 at least )  scotch whiskeys ever...","Took a tour of the Talisker Distillery. Tasted this at the end, oh my goodness; smoky, honey sweetness, spice and peppery. I loved it!","Rich, smokey, and woodsy in the nose. Rich and fruity on the palate, spicy and citrusy as it lingers, and finishes with some pepper and a sweet leathery note. The spiciness remains until it dies. \n\nMy current favorite. I measure all scotches by this right now.","Thirty-year blended scotch drinker.  My traditional go to Johnny Walker Black . My local liquor store had this on display so I tried it.   No bite, and smooth going down the throat. I like the light smoky flavor. The pepper came through right at the very end and I enjoyed sipping it. For me it was a nice change of pace.","Preparing for our next battle of taste testing, my brother and I made our selections to bring to  the table. His first, some cheap junk from the isles of Spey, that didn't even deserve to be on the field of honor, drew some early retorts. Then mine, STORM, silence swept the house leaving in it's wake total amazement. Thank you Talisker for my first and undisputed win. Someone at the plant burned the late night oil coming up with this. Job well done.","I never drink scotch but a friend made me try it. Loved the smokey richness in it. Went out and bought two bottles","This is by far my favorite whisky. It tastes rich from the start and ends even better. It is my standard, and I have found nothing comparable.","Love this single malt! The increase in smoke and spices has made Storm my choice before the 10 yo. Pairs so well with many of my favorite cigars. It is a staple in my cabinet!","Big improvement over the regular Talisker.  A much richer flavour.    I was sceptical about this,  as I consider the regular Talisker a bit bland, but it was on offer at a price too good to miss. I'm very glad I gave it a chance.  Three and a half stars.","I'm new to drinking whiskey...like only been a fan for 3 months even though I'm 52 ! But I'm loving trying out different types so time will tell what my faves will be. Unfortunately Talisker Storm will not be amongst them. I cannot comment on nose and palate as I'm not experienced enough...but I did find this way too smoky and a charcoal tinge to taste...with a lingering smoky medicinal after taste which I found unpleasant. I have tried Jura superstition which was a tad smoky and peaty and that was much better than this. I won't be buying this again.","Damn fine scotch, NAS be damned. It has just enough of that smokey, peaty goodness along with a slightly sweet and flavorful finish to make this offering from the Isle of Skye one of my favorite single malts I've drank in recent memory. If I cannot get Laphrohaig 10, this is definitely my scotch of choice! (Plus, it was on sale!)","I don't think this is as good as Talisker 10 Year Old or Distiller's Edition, but it is still a very nice, drinkable whisky, if you like it smoky and peaty (but not near Laphroaig level) with a salty edge. If you like Johnnie Walker Black you'll probably like this (as there's Talisker in JW).","Left the Glencairn unwashed overnight with a cover on it. Was suprised the next morning to pick up a slight aroma of rotten egg.\nCould this come from the burning of a sulphur candle to fumigate this sherry cask? Of course, the smokey peat was still strong.","Did not enjoy","If like me your wary of non age designation whisky, don't be with this offering.\nBurnt toffee, smoke, chilli, spice and warmth. What a great glass.\nIt is of course Talisker so be wary those who like the Glen whatever's.","Bought this for myself as a birthday treat. The pepperiness alluded to in the sales pitch does not disappoint. \nA sweet honey taste on the first sip lours you into the warm peppery taste which lasts in the mouth as whisky slips down smoothly. \nWonderful blend - and irrespective of \"age\" this oozes quality and \"ok, I'll have another\".","Nose is honeyed, but on retreat to about one inch from the glass(Glencairn) lip the struck match comes through.\r\nCertainly smokey and peaty, but much more mellow than Laphroaig or Ardbeg. Fruits come through also.\r\nTaste is IMO immediately spices then fruits. Of course, smoke and peat are strong in presence.\r\nFinish is long and IMO spicey.\r\nOverall, as a Ardbeg and Laphroaig fan, this is a very pleasant change or alternative. \r\nI bought one bottle from a large chain supermarket, tasted it, then bought a second bottle. Both came in a duffel coat type container as opposed to the box.\r\nA very nice peated whisky which is a good alternative to the Kildalton distillery products.\r\nFor what it is meant to be it deserves a high rating imo","First proper foray into whisky after years of saying I didn't like it. I love this! Not over powering like other whisky I've tried. It still has a kick and u have to put in a bit of water to tame it. Just lovely.","just finished the bottle. We had a few friends round over xmas and this was my choice for the evening. Not one person made a bad comment on the Talisker storm. It went down very well . Even the ladies enjoyed .

This was a gift, immediately looked it up. Definitely on my wish list. Recommended.","You absolutely must let it rest. This is obvious to most scotch lovers, but I occasionally see reviews where only the smoky\/medicinal nature is noted. Let it rest. This is a fine whisky that always transports me to a place of warmth, thought, and introspection.","As an individual taking his first tentative steps into the world of whisky I found this Scotch undeniably tasty. One can really taste the salty and sweet contrast which I found to be utterly exquisite.\n\n Anyone looking for a decent malt whisky for that cheeky winter toddy can't go far wrong in purchasing this tipple.","I usually drink Oban so nothing else to compare to. This storm is different but I like it just as much. It is gentler than Oban but still delicious powerful and enjoyable. Not an expert, just like my occasional drink on a cold winter night","Not a fan. Bought this having been drinking the normal 10 year old for years. Harsh is the word that comes to mind and reminds me of the cheap Island malts sold as super market owns. I will definitely not be buying this again.","Not a fan of the smokey flavor.  It was my bad for not reviewing more.   If you like the smokey flavor then this is a scotch for you.","Enjoyed this one. Very light smoke taste, easy to drink. May add a bottle to my collection for the winter.","Great!","There is a time and place for everything. Sometimes it''s a celebration, sometimes it''s for mellow moments like this Talisker Storm provides. It has deep and strong characters you don''t find much elsewhere. It''s called a Storm! You don''t go steaks for breakfast.","Love most everything from Talisker.\nThis one, tho it is a NAS whisky, has its place of drink me Labels. \nAs always, it has that salty brine going on with a fair amount of smoke and peat. I wouldn''t go so far as to say it has been turned up a notch, but the peppery finish is.\n\nIt has a bit of a struggle going on for what wants to be noticed first and last, with apples, buttery sweetness in between. \n\nThe nose and finish are what makes me happiest with this one.\n\nLovely dram.","I love this one, great whisky from Skye. slightly smokey and full of flavour","A STRONG SMOKEY FLAVOR WHICH I  LIKE; BUT SOME MAY NOT. \" BURNT WHISKEY\" .I''LL BUY IT AGAIN.","Great whisky.

I love it","Absolutely delicious, nice smokey taste, very smooth. Wouldn''t hesitate to have another bottle or 6","Reading the taste notes of Talisker Storm and then sampling same, left all in our party very disappointed.  There was hardly any hint of smoke and the ''back taste'' was of an oak bitterness left on the palate.  We were left wondering how this batch passed quality control.  Our evening was saved by several other different malts from Islay.","I like this a lot.  Great up front bite. Lots of smoky seaside tang. For me it does not linger as long as some, but great value for money.  Front of mouth hit rather than lingering throat fire. I could drink a lot of this ;-)","Superb! it deserves its name... I'll definetely turn it into my favourite smokey taste.","awesome, only tried it because it was on offer, now i''m in a real pickle as it was so good now i''m going to have to get a better job in order to continue enjoying this fine whiskey in future !!","Good whiskey, I thought i would try this as something different to my usual haunt of Jura. This whiskey has a smell of the sea, and a slight smell of oil (reminiscent of that small boat smell). Brings to mind the sea instantly, starting with a slight sweet note of honey, then hitting you with bitter citrus notes and then gently leaving you with a chilli pepper heat that delightfully tickles you.    \n\nNot as peated or as smokey as I would have hoped yet it is still another glass to add to my collection. Personally I would not try this whiskey again as it is slightly too salty for my taste.","Unexpected 50th birthday present from work. As a lover of Talisker generally, from 10 yo to cask strength, this has surprised me in it''s depth and quality. Very tasty, very smooth. Very recommended.","I have to say I really like Talisker 10 and McCall 18 (when I can afford it). This Storm appears a little smoother and let hot than the 10. I really like all three of these and will try Storm again. The great thing about Scotch is I can have so many options. One day smoky then one day fruitier. My stables are Grouse, 12 McCall and Tali 10, but I try them all and love most of them.","I tasted this after touring the Talisker distillery and was instantly sold. I''m normally more of a Speyside fan, but this is delicious. It has a really nice blend of peat, salt, fruit and honey. Leaves a lovely taste in the mouth that lingers.","This is certainly the best Scotch at its price.  I have heard a lot of complaints about it lacking an age statement. Such complaints are foolish.  Storm pours very nicely in a lighter color than it tastes. There is some rich honey, but the smokey and peaty flavors compliment the sweetness well. It is a very strong Whisky at 45.8%, which earns it a strong taste. For any gift or special occasion Scotch this is without a doubt the best deal out there.","Wonderful Christmas gift from my mother, lots of subtle and punchy tastes, a little bit of honey, a little bit of spice, and a smokey background.","A father's day present for me too. I'm a big fan of talisker 10, but I love this one too.","I enjoy Talisker.  I have few of their other expressions and find them all to be excellent.  My favorites are the Islays, but you can't live by Islay alone! Highly recommended.","My wonderful son bought me this for Fathers Day - what a fantastic choice!! Absolutely love it, beautiful Whisky.","New to the scene, I thought I may prefer a sweeter dram like Jura but in fact found the brine and smokey flavour of Talisker Storm to be more to my liking. Got this home and fell in love upon the first mouthful. Would certainly recommend to anyone!","being a fan of the 10 year old i decided to give the storm a go. the flavour is a fair bit more intense than the 10 year old. first off you get a strong brine, then a honey sweetness followed by the pepper, bonfire smoke and oak. really pleasant drinking.","Really easy-drinking whisky...probably one of the smoothest scotches I've ever tasted; no burning sensation in the throat from the extra alcohol either, just the enticing peppery finish. I think it's smokier\/peatier than the talisker 10 but not by much according to my slightly withered taste buds, although it's been nearly a year since I sampled the talisker 10.","I normally drink Isla whiskeys but this is really hitting the spot, would buy again.","We've been enjoying this one over the last month. Interesting how people are saying its more smoky than Talisker 10. For me Id agree with Rummidge. Its smoother... more briny, more maritime than the 10. Less of the smash you in the face, more give you a glancing slap. Lovely in the glass, and between 30-35 pounds you can argue it punches its weight although at 40 quid there are MUCH better options out there.","Good Whisky, tasty!","Sounds like what some Ardbegians hoped Ardbog might be","This is a very nice Talisker. Not really that much of a 'storm' though. In fact, it has a rather lovely sweetness and smoothness which makes it an eminently drinkable. If you like the 10 you will love this. I recommend you buy 2 bottles!","While it isn't the classic Islay peat, there is a definite zingy smokiness to Talisker that most lovers of peaty whisky will enjoy. It may not be your father's normal dram, but it should definitely be something for him to enjoy.","Thinking of my buying my dad this for his birthday, hes a fan of very 'peaty' whiskeys, my mum says the stuff he usually drinks taste like a mouthful of soil, would you say this is a good choice?","Talisker 10 is a classic ...end of, this whisky is more expensive,younger in style,less rounded not as drinkable...lovely nose but too bitter for me or maybe that's the peaty burnt embers!","@Rico That's right.

I tried it neat a while ago but it didn\u2019t do it for me. But now with a splash of water it makes sense. Not as instantly intense as Laphroaig 10, less medicinal but not much. Very smooth with a creamy feel on the palette. There really is a hint of coal and peat smoke. Peppery and long finish, not overwhelmed by the high abv. Still very much a Laphroaig so not for some people but if you like the 10 give this a go, excellent on a cold night.","My favorite Islay malt yet","Nose.  Salty smoke . Initial taste: Burnt wet leaves, with silky , hot pepper bite. Finish:  long, deep, spicy on the lips","Can't fault it, my favourite dram","Not bad. But not one of my favourite drams either.","Bought a bottle, last tried this one 2 years ago.\r\nQuality decreased immensely, peat is too overwhelming with a very sweet note. It used to taste like sea salt, windy island, peat, fruit, toffee -- now it's licking at fresh asphalt with syrup on it... Note that there is no age definition - you should go for the 10-year-old Laphroaig instead.","Transferred to a quarter cask part-way through maturation, this is a slightly sweeter and softer version of the standard 10 year old. Much less in-your-face, with a standard young Islay smoky sweet finish.","Delicately peated, a surperb nose . A very satisfying experience for your senses","I am enjoying this very much. I love the classic 10 y\/o in all its extremes and uniqueness. The QC is a little less medicinal, but it has plenty of smoke & peat. \n\nNeat -  On the nose it is recognisably Laphroaig (iodine, milder on the TCP than I remember the 10, ) and something sweet (honey\/maple), lemon & eucalyptus cough sweets.  On the palate - remarkably smooth and less hot than many an older whisky.  At 48% very approachable.  The impressions from the nose carry through here, with some brine and peat coming through.\n\nA few drops of water &  little time to breath - on the nose - softens the slight medicinal notes but brings the smoke forward.  All those (Strepsil) lemon cough lozenger notes on the neat nose now right there on the palette.  Sweetness, lemon balm, then coal tar soap,  Army & Navy sweets. A long, dry, warm finish, barbeque smoke, phenolic, salty finish.\n\nThis one is a hit! After the disappointment of the Select, a very good companion alongside the classic 10. A little less of the in your face swagger of the 10. But this is no pale imitation.\n\n48% abv, Non-chill filtered - yeah well done Laphroaig! So, why not just leave out the caramel colouring too?","Excellent the best Laphroaig so far -but lots more to try","This may sound absolutely stupid, but I have never been a lover of whisky till I was given a 70cl  bottle of this 48% quarter cask by someone (I don't remember who!!) either last Xmas or on my 80th birthday a year ago.  I didn't realise at the time that it was not a cheap drink but it is the only whisky I have ever liked the taste of.   The pleasant taste seems to hang in the mouth.  As I said, I know nothing about spirits of any kind but this one has turned me on.    Diolch.  Thanks a bunch to whoever gave it to me.","This bottle is the one, very good price, great nose peaty powerfull, taste is peaty smoke and complexe , aftertaste strong but in overall the 48% aint hard to take, very sweet but very strong peaty! This seems like laphroaig is pushing that way but the complexity is very great !! The best betwen ardbeg or lagavulin for the peat ! My favorite one !","If heavily peated whisky is your thing you'll struggle to get better than this for the money. Cracking value for money and a really good drinking whisky.","Lovely glass of whiskey, the taste is rich and complex. As an adept whiskey drinker, I would recommend this to any of my brethren. It's slightly less powerfull than the original Laphroaig - yet raises the bar for a handfull of brands in the same class. 5\/5","Terrific, complex, rich!","A beautiful dram.. Initially spicy and sweet and then the traditional strong peat smoke coming through, medicinal, slightly nutty I found .. long sweet finish.. much richer than the 10yr. Awesome stuff","What a surprising gift. Very smoky in the first tones, after that little sharp edge and after that warm, rich taste. Thats smoky cuddle stays in your mouth for a long time. Best for lazy, moody, cold evenings with book.","Wonderful! A birthday gift that keeps on giving! With fall upon us a simply fantastic way to slow down, enjoy the colors and the cooler evenings. The nose is robust without being pushy. That first sip and savor is to die for, rich, full and very rewarding. Later, the finish is lasting and oh so warming, almost like a hug from someone special. Then even later is that wonderful smokiness that is simply amazing.","Smoky and peat at first, after few minutes sweat and smooth love the combination! Finish long and sweet with touch of smoke. This NAS is much better then 10 year old in my opinion.","It's an amazing whisky and a terrific value for the money. Way better than others significantly more expensive.","Low rating because it seems you buy the pig in the sack so to say. I've tasted  Laphroaig 10 and QC a few years back. I've still got notes from the QC tasting. It was amazing to say the least! My nose all but exploded from the intense peatyness! I visited an old boat in Oslo a while back and it smelled just like that QC, strong tarred oak! The nose also had strong hints of what i would call new Wellington smell. Under this you had the regular hints of vanilla etc.\nNow, just 1 month back i bought a bottle of QC, and well, its a complete letdown, it tastes like the last sip of a dram of Uigeadail that spent the night without cover. Almost no peat, a taste of caramel and some cardboard box like taste.\nThe first time i tasted QC i would've given it an easy 9.4, it was simply amazing and different to anything i had tried to date.\nThis bottle is not even a 5, its like a cheap knockoff from china, someone pulled the cork out and replaced the content, its THAT BAD!","a freak of a good whisky","Having had this, I agree with another comment that others compared to this seem to flat or bland","In short, this is just one damn great whisky.","How is this not rated higher. It is an amazing whisky. Clean, subtle, medicinal? Yes, but in a tremendous way. I quite like it. I'd rate it at 4.5 stars if I had the option, I don't so I'm going 5 based on price, availability and overall experience.","Medicinal note comes from cresol phenolic compounds, which are present in greater volume due to the higher combustion temperature of the peat. Smokey guaiacol phenols are consequently reduced a bit. \nI agree about the variation in Ardbeg sometimes. 50% ex Jack Daniels first fill and 50% second fill. Wood may have been a bit too assertive.\nArdbeg is a very cleverly distilled whisky requiring fine balancing. A little too strong on the feints or slight change from the 10 minute Foreshots run can greatly alter the spirit.","Ok, but not what I was hoping for. Initial aroma was good, but taste is quite medicinal, oily, and sticky. It just doesn't go away.","I have had Ardbeg 10 on several occasions.  I was dis appointed with the last bottle-adventurous advertising ?Spmething was missing compared to the first ones I had which I enjoyed-tired casks and hurried distillation perhaps- never been disappointed with a bottle of Laphroaig, period!  This one is a cracker of a young whisky that has went the proper distance and is priced reasonably -take note Ardbeg-pay more money for good wood and take your time- Note to Lahroaig- put an age statement on this whisky-people won't mind buying younger stuff if it is done its business in good casks! Bought a bottle of NAS Bruchladdich that was disgraceful!","Colour - yellow golden, \n\nCoatline - thin fairly long lasting indicating presence of fatty oils\nLegs - thin and fast running indicating high alcohol, but young whisky.\n\nNose - oily, peaty, sweet, buttery. Changes further down the glass, oil becoming more prominent.\n\nPalate - oily, smokey, syrup, chilli, sometimes briny salty medicinal\n\nFinish - medium length, bonfire, smoke remains long. Oil disappears quickly. Medicinal \n\nConclusion - a nice peated whisky. Contrasts a bit with the Ardbegs. Ardbeg 10 is still, to taste, the peated whisky to beat. This quarter cask is a nice now and again whisky, but could IMO not replace Ardbeg 10 as a staple.","Golden yellow colour. Coatline is thin but long lasting, reflecting oily nature of the spirit. Legs are thin run quickly indicating fairly high ABV, but are long lasting.\nNose is oily peat and buttery.\nPalate varies sometimes salty, definitely oily, smoke in the background masked by the oil.\nFinish is fairly long, oily initially, but bonfire smoke is there in the length.\nIf you are not keen on oily spirits then maybe not for you.\nIMO perhaps matured too quickly.","Once I had a taste of laphroiag everything else is bland in comparison. It tastes like a cold night next to a bonfire.","I was lucky enough to get this for Christmas. Not as much of a 'nose' as regular Laphroaig, but definitely tastier. Neat, it tastes very medicinal, but this eases off with a splash of water, after which it's nice and earthy with a great mouthfeel. There is a marzipan note to the finish which I liked. It has a similar 'damp bonfire' aftertaste (in a good way!) to regular Laphroaig, and I was having 'taste flashbacks' a day or two after drinking. Very moreish and highly recommended.","I love the smokiness","Liquid heaven.  Earth tones, like just before it rains, pepper and vanilla tones.","I love this scotch!!!  The oily smokiness\/peatiness wraps around you like a blanket!  Outside of Cairdeas, Quarter Cask is simply amazing!","Outch !! Worst i ever bought.. Medicinal taste, way too harsh for my taste, alcool vapors get in your system and wont let you be, i'll stick with my fave Aberlour 12....","Of all the versions of Laphroaig I''ve had this is my favorite. Some reviews here have made me wonder if some are maybe adding Abit to much water due to it been 48%?  I find less is more with Laphroaig.\nBut the quarter cask is perfect for a cold winters night Round the fire, either in good company or in quiet contemplation. The quarter cask will reflect your winter evenings perfectly","Hey Jason (5th August) you review is brilliant!! I thought it was spot on for the most part however the rating is WRONG.!...!?\nThis is a 5 STAR WHISKY!! \nThere is no better whisky for the money, simple!","One of my absulut favorites and bang for the bucks Islay. Very typial Islay but with a very velvety oily cask taste, that you otherwise only find in older whisky.","Neither great nor awful ; the only way to describe this thing is that it is an experience. Huge smoke seeps out of the glass like creeping evil, staining the air itself. The flavor is massive - punishing peat and smoke gives the unfortunate soul drinking this the feeling that they just drank the liquefied remains of a fireplace, wherein the fire was put out with buckets of sea water. Oily iodine and notes of bloody bandages weave their way through a burst of sweet something or other, before leaving behind a taste of ash soaked in various antiseptics along with a hint of cured meat. Impossible to rate, but I am convinced that in order to fully complete the experience of being human, one needs to have this at least once.","Best value scotch from Islay. Unbeatable for the price. Many distilleries crank out poor quality, no age statement whiskys, however this is not one of them.  Note Laphroaig still uses floor maltings (one of very few to still do so). Having been to the distillery (which I highly recommend), I can say this is one of my favorites, and a great intro to Islay peat monsters.","You asked for a face melter, you got it. Nuff said. Awesome.","It''s a really stellar whiskey, all things considered. I''ll try anything up to ?100 but really, bang for your buck the quarter cask comes out on top. If you''ve never tried it and like this style of whisky it''s an absolute no-brainer. Love trying new whiskies, but always come back to this. Always remember the last place I drank it.","I prefer this to the 10 yr old, let's get that out of the way. It's stronger and that matters! It's different to the 10yr but I still love the 10yr to make that clear! The nose on this just keeps on giving, it's definitely laphroaig but more floral and fruity, less ashy and medicinal notes than the ten. One point to make is that although this is 48% I often don't add water, and as a norm, I usually do. If you've tried the usual suspects (ardbeg, lagavulin etc) and enjoyed them then you'll like this.","In all honesty it isn't all that dissimilar from the 10 year old, was expecting more of kick. But with that said it's still a great whisky and less iodine on the nose than the 10yo which makes it more pleasant in the nosing over long periods.","Gave into the great reviews, got my 1'st ever bottle of Islay the other day. Gotta say it lives up to the hype: Creosote aromas, tastes of peat, creosote, phenol, seaweed, salt, and lots more. Really full on and complex with a lovely long finish, smooth and powerful;Awesome. Just a heads up, start sipping neat, slowly add water. Water helps release the flavour's so you can really appreciate what this whiskey has to offer, even at 50\/50!","So good. Proudly Islay but smooth to drink. Complex taste and nose making it perfect for winter or after a hard day.","The QC is everything Laphroaig turned up to eleven but unfortunately the result is like a fingerpainted copy of the Mona Lisa, sort of there but not even close really.","This really is an immensely good whisky and a fantastic addition to the Laphroaig range. When you have the urge for a peat hit it's guaranteed to satisfy your need. Every peat lover should have a bottle in their collection.","Well priced Whisky!  My best Islay Whisky ever from Laphroaig....absolutely make no mistake. Bravo!","this is propably my current favourite... great value for money.","compr\u00e9 mi primer botella de Quater Cask hace un a\u00f1o, es un gran whisky, mucha madera y las notas t\u00edpicas de Islay se mezclan con sabiduria. Muy recomendable.","This is a great dram, the tasting notes are spot on!  An inticing nose is followed by a soft mouth despite it's high ABV, then the intense complexity comes through.  A driving warmth of beautiful peat that follows like a waft of pleasant smoke which lingers nicely afterwards.  Quality and distinguished.","I tend to think of Laphroaig 10 as my 'old faithfull', but now I'm sitting with my first glass of QC, I feel as though that position may be under threat. I've yet to taste them side by side but what strikes me about this one is the prominence of charred oak and how it lingers around for longer than with the 10yo. Excellent stuff.","Great nose and taste... Not as balanced as Lagavulin 16 and Ardbeg. Not as powerful as Ardbeg. Leave it for an hour and you will get Vanilla and Cinnamon some Baileys Irish cream smell. Nice peat smoke, and tastes like tarry and oily at times, as soon as you exhale you are bombarded with a charred log of wood. A little aniseed \/ clove but most people confuse the alcohol sting with pepper. Nice but doesn't leave you pondering like Ardbeg or Lagavulin...","I have totally changed my opinion about Laphroaig, thanks to QC. The soft smokiness, fruitiness, salt, vanilla, cinnamon... \neverything in perfectly balanced harmony. Relaxing, reminds me Lagavulin 16 yo.","I do prefer Ardbeg over this, however considering the price, its the most popular malt in my cupboard.  Very heavy peat, iodine, medicine, sea salt and a certain sweetness I cant put my finger on.  I love this stuff.","Had a couple of glasses over the weekend.  First taste, there is a fantastic level of smoke here, some medicinal, phenolic character but overpowered by the aroma of a fireplace.  Balanced flavour again with enormous smoke which lingers as ash on the finish.  Really impressed with this.  Next day similar but kippers rather than fireplace smoke dominates which makes it a bit less exciting.  Still a great Laphroaig.","I've been wanting to sample a bottle of Laphroaig Quarter Cask for a while now, & it certainly didn't disappoint. A massive peaty sucker punch to the palette. A sheer delight!","this is superb stuff, just has you would expect from Laphroaig.\nIn a word stunning!","I think the TF review got it close to perfect.","@James: Lagavulin 16 is an all-time classic, I find it much richer than Laphroaig. It's much drier too, none of that sweet peat that's found in Laphroaig. They're both great, but Lagavulin is more satisfying - you'll love it.","Hmmm this one was a bit of a disappointment for me given how much I enjoyed the Laphroaig 10. I found it nowhere near as rounded or smooth as the 10 and the extra proof served only to further mask the smoky character that I was expecting from this malt. It's finish was muted and overall left me reaching for my Laphroaig 10 to renew my faith in my own taste buds. Hmm... I wonder if the Lagavulin 16 will be any better...","The first whiff, and I was in Islay, seaweed, peat, ocean spray, and I could actually smell the salt","This is my first Laphroaig, and I really enjoyed it. Huge amounts of peat and smoke of course some small hints of salt and a nice long finish. Hints of sweet vanilla combined with the other flavours do give a slightly medicinal impression, but this did not put me off -- in fact the medicinal hints reminded me of Yoichi, one of my favorite Japanese whiskies.","This is a stunning Malt Whisky and a real treat: Feisty Sea-spray and black pepper on the nose, a structured arrival with a smoky bite that melts on the tongue with an oaky, tangy-citrus firewood that finishes with a mouth filling smoke and peat warming the throat. I'm trying the 10yo Cask Strength next","Oily mouthfeel. This is a peat \/ smoke bonfire that is very representative of Islay. Starts out sweet, delicate, followed by towering peat and smoke.  It is refined, not rough or sharp.  Mid-palate the American oak casks appear.  Smokey, but not over the top. Again, reminiscent of a heap of damp branches set afire out in the woods on a fall day with the drizzle of rain overhead. Limes and ginger. Flavors linger for a very long time.","Excellent peaty whisky. Preferable to the 10yo which is also splendid. A favourite of mine and my friends. You wont find better for the price","a peat bomb and i love it.woody.maybe little dry but good.48%.some peppery.a lot of flavours recomended.laphroaig is one of the most peaty whiskys in the market a real killer","This is my absolute favorite singel malt. If I had to choose a bottle to take whith me to a desserted island, this is the ONE, no doubt","I love the Laphroaig QC. Only one problem: my wife is now drinking my whisky. She used to wrinkle her nose at the Laphroaig 10, 15, Laga 16, etc. Made the mistake of getting caol ila and it seems she's acquired a taste for islay. Thought, \"oh yeah? I'll try QC. Surely, it will have too much attitude and she'll stick with her little gin\/tonics.\"No luck. And now, I must share!","This is a really good islay whisky, but I love it mixed with a little Laphroaig 15. They really complement each other. Adding a little 15 (around a 1\/3 or more) to this well rounded malt, gives it the complexity it lacks (which is the only thing).","Very Nice ... would like it more if it had an oiler mouth feel.","I like Lagavulin and Ardbeg but I just can't quite get into this.  It doesn't come across as complex to me.  A bit of toffee, a lot of smoke, an oily taste like hash oil.  Industrial.  The other Islay malts have more of a balancing sweetness in my opinion.","I just bought a bottle . I agree with comments about the caol ila . I ilke the nose and the long complex finish more so than the pallat . A new discivery for me and i really like it .","They call it Quarter CASK but it actually comes in a Bottle. What a rip off!","This stuff is like medicine - one to avoid. It tastes like iodine mixed with dettol and savlon. Apparently cigar smokers \"enjoy\" it because they can still taste some modicum of whisky whils smoking.Not even remotely drinkable IMHO.Ardbeg any day to this muck.Yuck","A typical islay one, but a bit more smoky than Lagavulin and almost identical to Ardbeg 10 years old.","Fans of this please try Caol Ila 12 year old as you will love that too.","I got a bottle for ?23 the bargain of the century. Along with caol Ila my current fave from Islay with Bowmore 12 just behind.","Having considered the merits of this over a few weeks, compared to the other two uber-peaty Islay malt 'big guns' available for a sensible outlay - Ardbeg 10 and Lag 16 - I am minded to give this the crown. Yep, the big centre-stage peaty song-and-dance turns up the volume - as you might obviously expect with this - but once you get beyond the medicinal warmth there's a quite exceptional, and pleasantly surprising, sweetness of finish.  An absolute steal at this price.","Big peat and smoke,vanilla lingering in the background.Do I like it,hell yeah!!!!!","This is a more complex and reserved expression of Laphroaig than the two 10 y.o. Both sweet and sour (the extra cask adds more than it takes), campfire as much as peat smoke at times but that Laphroaig length is always behind it pushing toward shore against the tide. I can only dream about what the cask strength version would taste like. Maybe we'll get the chance in a future expression...","I was bought this as a christmas present last year, and have now aquired the taste for peat! This year, i had another bottle bought for me, and have also tried Lagavulin 16yo - I'm torn between the two... Buy both and see how you get on. Not for the faint hearted!","My first introduction to Laphroaig was the 10 year old, which I fell in love with.  The quarter cask however has vibrant aromas with a powerful complexity of flavours followed by a long smooth warm finish.I can\u2019t seem to find the Grandparents' musty apartments as described by Dr. Whisky!  I\u2019ll enjoy this for years to come.","You wouldn't  thing it was younger than the 10 or the 16 year old, so smooth is it. The medicinal peatiness is also more intense. Experts can probably get more out of the older products. Its wonderfull.","Deeper, richer, sweeter, stronger, more medicinal and more peaty than the 10 y-o.  The quarter-cask process is a winner, and 48% is a lovely strength.  This is my favourite Laphroaig.  Not much dearer than the 10 y-o, and sometimes can be found cheaper.  I always have a bottle on the go, and another full one in reserve.  Quarter-cask nights are special.  Breathtaking stuff.","Glad I bought this ! More subtle than the 10 year old and has oak and nuts in the nose as well as the usual signature laphroig smells. The taste is full and builds into the smoke with a long finish. Quite sweet too - wow !","Having been a Laphroaig drinker for many years, I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised to nose and naturally taste the quarter cask. I was even more surprised that my wife had noticed it on a supermarket shelf and bought it for me! I found it extremely enjoyable from the first to the last drop which sadly came too soon. Maybe I will have to take the wife Christmas Shopping?"],"184":["\nHarsh - not as good as the 12 year old, but more expensive.\nI really don't see the point of this one\n","\nVery harsh.

However, the aroma and flavor started going downhill after the bottle was opened for a month and only about 2\/3 level.  This precipitous drop in aroma and taste was very disappointing.

Whisky is very friendly, gentle, delicate for its proof, young, but already well-composed, fruity and floral profile transferring us to the shores of Islay beaches.\n","\nI keep coming back to this one, happy each time.

Very very smooth!\n","\nI'd seen some pretty poor reviews of this whisky and that along with the fairly steep pricetag put me off buying a bottle.\nHowever, I saw a bottle behind the bar when up visiting Orkney and thought I'd order a dram to try for myself. I ended up being pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it far more than any of the other three whiskies I tried that night.\nA pleasant whisky and very drinkable. Still maybe slightly expensive for what it is but I will be ordering a bottle off the back of the sample I tried.\n","\nAn incredibly dram, soft yet fiesty!\nLight, sweet, vanilla with a subtle nutty\/salty finish.\n","\nI agree,it needs a little drop of water to release its fruity flavours.It is a decent drop.\n","\nI tried this firstly without adding water, and got that astringent whack of new oak, furniture polish and little else... you can tell it's a youngster. But with some water, it thankfully softens. It still tastes young, but the stewed apple taste (which in older Bruichladdich's I've tasted grows into gorgeous toffee-apple flavours), starts to come out. It's also quite dry (that'll be the oak tannins again). It's pleasant but not complex, and not a star.\n","\nAbsolutely lovely. A true classic scotch. This is how it should be done. Delightful !\n"],"187":["\nExquisite. All I have come to expect from an Islay single malt.\n","\nJust tried this for the first time, opening the bottle and taking a whiff the smokiness hits me hard.

Very dry and minimal sweetness - just the way I like it ! Then tried it with few drops of water and the rounded mellow was significantly reduced, so never again with water.

One to sip and savour on a damp night.  Let the dram breathe, take a sip and just enjoy the finish that goes on forever. It's a dram many will either love or leave.  No doubt where my thoughts are.","Super vegetal. Steamed spinach. Expensive hand-made leather shoes. New car smell\/taste. Lemon pound cake. Peanut oil. Blood oranges. Figs. Dried nectarines. Cola gummies. Marzipan. Peppermint. Hint of blood sausage, heavy maltiness. Drying. A hint of medium-dark chocolate way in the background. Full, prominent vanilla. Icing sugar. Saline smoke some malt-smoke. Distinct aroma of East Caribbean rums, especially out of the bottle. Perfume-like. Aromatic. Minimal oak. Peppermint completely takes over with enough time and water. like menthol Kools. All in all, mellow, complex, very refined, very luxurious. This is a vegetal, *peaty* malt, not a smoky one. Sapid but soft. Friendly. Reviewed with 1 teaspoon of water.","A whisky that can be described as brutal, in the best possible way. Honestly, I loved and enjoyed Lagavulin and Laphroaig in all their peaty glory, but this scotch seems to truly subjugate your senses more than any I've tried thus far. This is perhaps by virtue of its limited sweetness, although it is nonetheless delightfully creamy and delicate in the midst of the smoky storm that seems unending on the pallet. And this scotch truly never seems to quit--its salty peat will parch your mouth long after a dram is finished. It truly wrestles your mouth with all kinds of pungent, amazing flavors. I just wrote a bunch of flowery words about this whisky, but I'm not as good a wordsmith as the fellow who simply described Ardbeg 10 as \"epic.\"","Great mouth full of smoke and brine and kelpy salt that evolves into a warm softness. This is a pure expression of what the wine poofs refer to as \u201cterroir\u201d - a reflection of place, more than method.  The 10-year is a tremendous example of what whisky should be.","Better before 4 years but still intact and value for money!","Great whisky","Who ever Stephen is, he obviously isn\u2019t familiar with peat","Epic","Ardbeg is like a barbecue beside the ocean, compared to laphroaig's campfire out at sea.","The smell is overpowering - all around the bottle there's a cloud that smells like mold and gasoline. Either we got a bad bottle, or we're missing something that some people love. Yuck.","I live in Japan and just started to get into whisky seriously. Of course I have access to all the most popular midrange price-wise whisky. But once I tried Ardber I cannot get enough of it. Please make more!","Proper smoked whisky, great one for anyone who enjoys peaty, smokey scotch, lovely finish & aftertaste, fantastic","Islay malts are my favorite with bowmore at the top. I tried this and cannot get the smell and taste of coal tar soap out of my mind. Although I have never tasted coal tar soap...","I'm quite the noob when it comes to whisky. My palate is nowhere near sophisticated, but I was blessed with a tongue that is highly tolerant of the burn of alcohol. I usually treat myself to a new bottle of whisky once per month. So far my favorite is Suntory Hibiki, but this one is excellent as well. My advice to other noobs is to keep this in your mouth until the burning stops. The instant the burning stopped, my eyes damn near popped out my head because of a sudden burst of chocolatey flavor hit me. I havent quite tasted any fruity flavors, but I'm not an experienced alcoholic yet. The pepper \"notes\" are quite obvious in the \"finish\". This smells really nice too. I think the peaty\/smoky aroma is an acquired taste (smell?). Try to analyze the smell and taste and over time you'll appreciate it more.","I opened the bottle and the smell of gasoline hit me.  I poured 2oz glass with a bit of ice and let it sit for a few minutes. Still smelled and tasted like gasoline and yes I've tasted gas way back in my teen years.  Mixed it with an Oz of water and still not good. It's now mixed 3oz water to 2 Oz whisky.  It's barely drinkable. I may have to mix it with something else to get through the rest of the bottle.\n\nI'm really new to the scotch scene so my unsophisticated palette might be showing.  I've got a three more bottles on the way of various brands and ages.  I'll come back to this one after trying some others.","Blindingly beautiful.","Its the best whiskey I ever tried. Sounds rough, but I 've tride some blends like 21 years Johnnie, 21 year old Glenfarclas and I can say that Ardbeg 10 yeats old is whisky for the man which have some beast inside them really. Not for everybody for sure. Islay single malt are not for everybody for sure at all. For me the peat in the palate is not so much, but the whole flat smells like it. I love it so much. Its a real treat and medicine for me, the throat seek or the voice string got sore, I just get some elixir of Ardbeg 46% vol and solve it around. The taste is hillarious. My cousin which is 20 years old can not understand it, so my father 50 years old can not too. But I do. The tase and the soul of it whiky does make a sense for me. If you are a whisky (whiskey if you try some irish or japan or american) lover your should try the Ardbeg 10 y old. I would like to try some older whiskys of this distellery, but for the time being can not afford it. But if 10 y.o. is that superior quallity than toher marks would be evenbetter i thingh thougt.","A great intro to Islay single malt.  Give it a chance. Although no Lavaglulin, it's a great start!","This is a whisky that simply gets better and better the longer you leave it to oxidize. At first, treat it like a fine wine, and let it breathe for a while. You won't be disappointed. The peat is overpowering and tends to mask the fruity, meaty, tobacco notes. It's truly divine. A real gem of a whisky. Be gentle with it. Take your time. Let a whole new world open up to you. Trust me. It's that good. 10\/10 \n\nOne of the best examples how good Scotch whisky can really be.","This was my favourite whisky for a long time. I bought a bottle at Christmas and while it's still a very very good Islay, I feel it's lost a bit of the sweetness it used to have. The peat and smoke is still there in spades but I feel the current bottle I have is lacking a little bit of sweetness and complexity that used to make it so perfectly balanced. I am seeing Ardbeg 10 a lot more in supermarkets these days, so I wonder if increased demand has anything to do with it? If you like very smoky peaty whisky this is still an excellent choice, however this most recent bottle reminds me a little more of a cask strength Laphroaig, it's dominated by peat and smoke. The bottles of this I picked up a few years ago had a Highland Park sweetness, slightly saltier and fresher and perhaps a hint less smoke. Very good but not as great as I remember it.","An excellent Islay whisky. Very pleasant nose, just the right amount of peat, and a wonderful long finish that reminded me of high percentage dark chocolate after giving the whisky plenty of time in my mouth to reveal its more subtle notes.  A dram that I would give to a close friend to introduce them to the wonders of Islay.","Smoke, smoke and more smoke. Like drinking a campfire, quite medicinal also.  Not sure I'd like this being a lover of highland whisky like Glenmorangie but I did.","With Ardbeg 10, the smokeyness is incredibly well balanced and not at all overpowering.  There is some very faint brine\/sea like taste, hiding somewhere in the background. The producer's tasting notes are definitly right about that one!\nOn addition of water, the chocolate takes the stage. \nI fail to notice any of the pepper\/ chili or lemon some reviewers talk about. If anything, there may be a hint of overripe strawberry. \nIt is also very smooth.","One of the best Islay Scotches ever! Such a complex and legendary whisky. Always my go to for Islay's.","Being relatively new to the single malt Scotch scene and starting with Highland whisky this was so over the top smokey I wasn't sure I would finish the bottle. I'm now half way through the bottle and with a little more time this is a fantastic whisky.  I can really pick up the sweet under tones, just fantastic. I will definitely pick up another bottle soon.","I am not a big fan of Single malt. But I should say, this one left me wanting for more! Excellent.","This is magnificent stuff. If you don\u2019t like peat or smoke, you shouldn\u2019t be buying this. But it\u2019s not one dimensional. Beneath the obvious peat and smoke, there\u2019s some light citrus at the beginning, sweet maltiness on the palate and some great dark coffee and chocolate notes on the finish.  A bit brighter and less sweet than Laphroaig, not quite as rich as Lagavulin, but Ardbeg is its own thing. Great stuff, highly recommended.","Horrible. Undrinkable.","Absolutely marvalous!!!","Ardbeg is my preferred scotch.  The taste is so multi-layered, it is like a ride.  If you don't like Ardbeg, turn in your man card and drink a Bacardi.","Cracking!","I don't think it's fair for people who don't enjoy peated whisky's to give this a low score. \nI only just tried this (and islay whisky in general) for the first time recently while I was in the UK and absolutely loved it. My palate isn't that well developed but even I could pick up a lot more than just smoke. \nI'll definitely get another bottle once the current one is empty.","excelent!!","This is the only scotch I've ever tasted that legitimately made me nauseous three hours after having one glass. The taste still lingered almost a full day afterward.\r\n\r\nYou can put aside the fact that it tastes like nothing but muddy water that's had used gauze pads from a hospital's trash soaking in it. That alone is just sort of a turn-off.  \r\nIrredeemably awful.","I think this whisky is terrible. Read reviews of it being favorable to Laphroaig and bought it. Over priced fire water with hints of scorched peat and jalapeno.  Makes you wonder.","I can not understand these bad reviews! The only people who don't like this style of whisky are those who don't appreciate the peated whiskys.. Fantastic flavours going on here for those who love the peated malts.. a bit lighter than the likes of Laphroaig and Lagavulin but ever bit as good! Love it","excellent whisky is an excellent natural presentation, peat, inscence smoke, vegetal, slightly medicinal, great long finish.... btw a message to the whisky exchange: get your facts straight this whisky is not coloured, it is natural colour","This is a great product,i was very surprised by the pale color but in overall i have nothing bad to said if i dont look at the price ! Could take Laphroaig for less or a little bit more Lagavulin 16 .","Very, very nice. I've just learned that my great-great-grandfather, one Robert Thorne, got Auchtoshan up and running (1823,) and comparing his whiskey (specifically, their contemporary Three Wood), with the Ardberg 10, I rather wish Robert had moved from Devonshire to Islay instead of Paisley. I might then be even more proud of him. \nNot yet versed in the lingo of whisky , I can only say that the Ardberg has the advantage on my tongue at this moment in time: It's a lot more 'gutsy' and it better supports my fantasies of old Scottland.","First class all the way.  My all-time favourite, love the head-clearing blast of peat. To be enjoyed slowly.  Regretfully I will never be able to progress beyond the 10yo without mortgaging the house.","Absolute magician's birthday","Whenever I try a new brand, I open the bottle and pour a shot. A sip, smooth. Another sip, flavorful, still smooth. The rest of the shot, still smooth, excellent aftertaste. This is the first shot of any scotch of any kind that a shot didnt make my throat constrict. I normally like scotch over ice, a splash of soda. I think this is the bottle I've been searching for. Drinking it the way I do, the flavor shines through. I immediatly go to my Happy Place. Great stuff.","Great product, better than blue label.","Unless I want something for summer, this is my drink of choice. This is my favorite. My friend intoroduced me to this some years ago; at that time I had a nice selection of single malts. After my first taste, I could not drink any other scotch for at least a month, they were all not tolerable by comparison.","Very medicinal, very peaty and smoky, i did not find any complexity nor any good taste besides the smokiness.  I recommend the uigeadail.","I feel I have to leave a renewed review as I first tried this whisky nearly two years ago (early in my whisky education) and gave a fairly negative review. I now feel that my inexperience with whisky caused me to view this harshly, having recently retried all i can say is wow. So much that i missed on my first attempt that i can now appreciate the complexities of flavours, this now sits comfortably in my favorites along with Caol Ila and Lagavulin.","Smokey, coal, pepper and chilli, long heating finish.","as the previous writer described this as similar to cepacol I thought I would try it on my sore throat. not only is it honey flavored, it soothes your sore throat. To the nose it is pleasant and mellow with the taste lingering and coming through to provide a warming and spicy sensation to the palate.  I will give it three stars and enjoy th rest of the bottle. Slainte..","Without exception, Ardbeg is my least favourite whisky. The only way I can describe it is that it smells and tastes exactly like Cepacol, the sore throat medicine. Absolutely awful.","Better than some Islay malts but very strong peatiness is too overwhelming.  Just about drinkable if drowned in spring water but otherwise give me a Campbell Town any day.","Excellent option for peatey taste. Bit more complex than laphroag","I almost never write more than one review of any product (scotch whisky is the only product I have ever written a review of), but in this case I feel it's warranted.  I initially reviewed Ardbeg 10 yr in July (also anonymously) and this is my third or fourth bottle since then.  I'm not a light drinker, I just like variety and always have multiple bottles open at a time.  This stuff just seems better every time.  Not only is Ardbeg, in my humble opinion the best Islay malt, it is one of the best entry level malts you will ever have period.  Not only does it taste great, it may also be the single greatest value in scotch whisky.  I always find it for less than $50, American in the NYC\/Long Island area.  For those of you who live here or have ever visited you know that's a great deal.  I couldn't recommend this stuff more. Enjoy and a happy and healthy new year to all","I already wrote a review of this about six months ago.  I usually don't write more than one review of any product but in this case I feel it's warranted.  I love strong flavored whiskers whether it be from peat or sherry.  I just cracked open my third or fourth bottle of Ardbeg 10 since my last review.  It just seems better every time.  I never thought I could make the following but I will: this is simply the best Islay malt that you can have.  Not only is it (imho) the best Islay malt, it is one of the best entry level malts you can find period.  In addition to being great it is also a great value.  Could not recommend this product more.  Good job at 46% abv, no chill-filtration and no color added","just great overall, the smoke is there but doesn't overshadows the rich palate of flavours.","Of the ardbeg range,  my favorite , of islay my favorite.  There's a lot going on in this dram. Nothing is to much or to little.  Extremely complex.  Peat, smoke, sea shells, sea brine, caramel, toffee and a wonderful olive saline brine.  A decadent dram","Just cracked open a bottle of this and must say what a dram! The nose is delightful the coal smoke and delicate sweetness compliment each other beautifully,along with the hints of spice to come.  On the palate a lovely thick mouthfeel with a mellow sweetness like a mcvitties gold bar, this is followed by a huge gut punch of peat that melds with the sweetness rather than overpowering it. Finally comes the tingly pepper and chilli that perfectly finishes it off. The finish is long, the gift that keeps giving if you would. Ordered a bottle of uigeadail and Laphroaig QC can't wait to compare a happy boy!","Excellent taste. By My personal rating - In a top 3 of 10 years aged whiskey - Talisker, Ardbeg and Laphroaig. On My taste Talisker a bit better for me. Anyway Ardbeg is one of that I can recommend without any doubts.","I am fairly new to the scotch market, but this one is top notch. I love the earthy and peaty smoke. Our of the 6 Or 7 smoky drams dreams I have sampled, this one is my favorite so far.","Drinking neat: Peat, brine, vanilla custard, sweet floral, root beer\/cream soda, tobacco, sharpie, sugar sweet, spicy, oily, decadent","I think of Ardbeg 10 as a muscular younger brother to some of the Ardbeg family's more refined and older siblings.  Ardbeg Rollercoaster is my favorite, followed by Galileo,  Uigeadail, and Dark Cove.  However, Ardbeg 10 makes an unapologetic and dramatic entrance at a very palatable price point.  I like it and recommend it to my friends who tend to think you have to spend more to get a good scotch.  Ardbeg 10 and Laphroaig 10 are exceptional offerings that don't harm your pocketbook.  Love it.","I might not know much about whisky, but do I know one thing, this was damn good","Rich is so wright. Wonderful. I've enjoyed a lot. Very complex. Hard to drink moment than two. Congrats. Constantin","Superb smoky and peaty complexity. The experience will stay with me for years to come.","My attempt at some notes, bare in mind I'm reasonably inexperienced: Nose- peat. Less medicinal than others I've tried, fire side and seaweed.\nPalate - at first, drying spicy smoke, seaweed and salty things still. After a while more sweetness comes through, almost menthol\/mint freshness and a contrasting malty sweetness , something a little crisp - faint pear?\n\nFinish - drying, the menthol freshness remains and The smoke fades to a faint whisper. \n\nAs bad as my notes probably were, rest assured it was fantastic!","If you have the patience I suggest leaving this whisky for more than an hour, covering and exposing alternately. What is revealed is a marked change in the spirit with pepper coming very much to the fore, possibly from first fill ex JD casks, also, the esters become more prominent as well, smoke of course is always there.\nI usually take about 2 hours or more to consume a malt, IMO it reveals aromas and flavours, which are hidden in the depths.","Superb. On opening the bottle, toffee and peat but in the glass the iodine takes over. Swilling the glass brought out citrus and fresh flowers. In the mouth a burst of sweetness followed by rapidly changing flavours, from toffee to cream to vanilla to coffee to charcoal and liquorice. \nThe finish starts as liquorice and on smacking my lips, treacle and pepper. Iodine a couple of minutes into the afterglow. \nIncredible for the price and availability.","Another great Islay malt. On the nose I get peat mixed with malt. On the palate a sweet liquorice like sweetness at first. Then the peat takes over. The malty tones mix in nicely. On the long finish I get more malt, but it's the smoke that really lingers. I also get hints of tobacco.Very good body at 46% abv. I like this as much as I like Laphroig and Bowmore. I'm a person who likes variety in my malts so I always have a few different types open at a time. It's a must for me that they are unique like this one","No colorant added, great alcohol content and a decent value. This is, by far,  the best readily available single-malt if you enjoyed a peated malt. The taste starts with a nice sweetness and quickly moves to tastes of smoke, peat, beach-side, savory meat, licorice and mint.  The finish is very long and smoked with a touch of sweet and bitterness. The finish is fairly similar to Laphroaig 10. The taste is much more interesting and more comparable to Lagavulin 16 and it's bottled nonchill-filtered and uncolored at a 46% giving it a nice boost over the other two malts.","First time trying - first sip = perfection!   So much great flavor!!!!!  Love it!","Disappointed.  Didn't suit me even though I've properly enjoyed quite strongly-peated Islays.  Repeat visits didn't warm me to it.  Maybe its the pushy hickory\/ tobacco\/ stale bonfire smoke that kill its initial sophistication, by going overboard alongside the full peat and tartness.  Dank is a hard to use word for whisky, but I regret it made my nose wrinkle at the taste. Thinking more dilution was the answer, I kept trying - yet there was no correct amount of water that could solve this imbalance.  I hate giving two stars for an earnest single malt, but its just not me.  Tamlin is not a sole maverick dissenter!","Veryood","The daddy of all whiskys. consistantly fabulous. An aquired taste, but when you have exhausted all other whiskeys this one keeps you coming back for more.","Wonnerful schortch, I LOVE the peet.  Mike from the Colonies (after a few drams)","Sorry, but the medicinal phenols killed this for me. I want to enjoy my whiskey without getting the distinct aroma of a med lab in my nose. Call me a tasting heathen but I expected more than a constant reminder of doctors, lab work, and illness literally under my nose when all I wanted was a nice, pleasent drink.","\"Nose\" (diluted)\nPhenol, mint, smoking damp wood bonfire, wet leaves.\n\n\"Palate\" (diluted)\nMore subdued.  Smoother, softer, silken but still with plenty of smoke, tar and black peppercorns in the centre.  Smokey bacon too.\n\n\"Finish\" (diluted)\nThis is where the excitement starts.  The malt started as sweet peat upon the palate, transitions in great form to a sea spray dry evaporation of flavors like:  white capped waves of salt, lingering green seaweed, tarred fishing boat ropes.  White cheddar and more ashy, soot and smoke leave you reaching for more.\n\nThis is better with a teaspoon of water to a double pour.","Outstanding. My first Islay malt and I'm thrilled with it. So many flavors, so much complexity. Great value as well.","Exceptional","Maybe not my all time Ardbeg favorite, but definitely the best of the regular range. Overall quality here is still sky high. That's an astounding accomplishment, given the high demand.  I'm glad Ardbeg has followed it's own vision and not followed Laphroaig.","i have bought the uggie and corry among other nas versions ahem,dark cove. get this wonderful ten year while you can.it is delicious.","Coatline remains for a long time, though thin, reflects oil present.\nLegs run slowly medium thickness.\nNose is peat and smoke, vanilla and sweetness, Limey zest, then bonfire and burnt wood\nPalate peaty and smokey, some chocolate flavours. This is a multilayered whisky.\nFinish - very long and strong, peat and smoke, bonfire. Leaves a coat on the tongue\n\nConclusion - IMO is the bench mark for a peated whisky, nothing comes close. The dumpy lamp glass spirit still, purifier on the Lyne arm and the wooden Washbacks for fermentation retain the peat, yet it is somewhat refined.","This is a beautiful Islay malt. I'm big Laphroaig fan but this might , JUST might top it. I like the saltiness and especially the peppery spice you get from holding the malt in your mouth for 5-10 seconds. Lovely malt , I highly recommend it.","In this scotch, perfection has been attained!!!  Wow!!!  If you are lucky enough to enjoy a dram or bottle, savor it!!!","excellent value for such a great islay whisky ! smokey notes with a lingering liquorice after taste ! this whisky is my happy place !","Full on Islay full of peat and smoke.  Yum","The 10yo Ardbeg is one of the best single malts that I've ever tried. I love the peaty malts from Islay & this is now becoming my favourite one out of Lagavullin, Laphroig & Ardbeg.","Pure heaven! This is the most delicious whiskey I've ever had.  Wonderful nose, exquisite,  sumptuous taste with notes of smoke, peat and honey.  And OMG the aftertaste is long, lingering, and beautiful.   Truly a masterpiece!","Smoke and fire - wonderful nose, palate and long smoke finish - Complex - Sweetness, pepper and spicy, Peat,tobacco smoke, seaweed and strong espresso coffee palate - great value Ardbeg - highly recommended for lovers of Islay peated single malts","Also one that you cannot forget! Rough and tasty!","Love the charcoal smokey peat flavor! A great scotch at a great price!","If you are a fan of peaty \/ smoky whisky and you haven''t tried this - you''ve not lived . Just delicious and in my opinion you will not find a better islay malt at this price . If I could only have one bottle in the house - this would be it . Sensational.","A very nice Islay scotch, one of the big three peat monsters. Whereas Laphroaig is brutal and Lagavulin is deep and brooding, Ardbeg was more complex and sweet. Of course, the peat and smoke are there in spades - huge waves of smoke in fact - but there is also a curious pronounced sweetness that swirls itself around the massive peaty smoke vapours. Taste-wise, there''s a hint of liquorice sweetness on the finish, preceded by big peat, campfire, cured meat and honey flavours. A big dram, though not as imposing as I thought it would be. I found Talisker 10 to be a much wilder and more rugged scotch, but this one has a certain charm to it. I prefer Lagavulin and Talisker when it comes to smoky scotch, but this is a really good dram.","I must confess i was afraid of trying it after reading lots of reviews and being a beginner (just tried the glenlivet 18, glenmorangies, balveni 12, glenlivet 12, glenfiddich 12 and jonnhy walkers).\n\nMan this is just fantastic as it is told. I found it less smoked and lighter than it is said and extremely complex. I was eager to have a  second try in the day after. So many flavours! Try it late at night, choose your favorite sound and study it.\n\nI read about it being misfit in hot countries. Forget it. This is a top one and worth  wherever you may live. \n\nAnd what a finish it has! It is endless! Do not die before you try.","First Ardbeg whisky I tried and I have to say it blew my mind. Immense smoky taste. Could not recommend more.","I wanted to thank site \"Whisey Exchange\" because of helping me to come into the wonderful world of scotch whisky.It''s been a year how i started drinking alcoholic  beverages.Nationals beverages of Serbia and Balkan - plum brandy,wasnt that good,beer either,only good was high quality vine is ok,but ...In October 2014. one client gifted me \"Jack Daniels\" and my wife and i were pleasantly surprised.I started searching scotch whisky,and your site helped me a lot.In my country most people link scotch whiskey with some brands of blended whiskies such as \"Johny Walker\" or \"Ballantine''s\", but for the \"Single Malt\" they didnt even hear about. Thanks to You, i''ve been buying \"Single Malts\" in some specialized supermarkets and till now i''ve tasted \"Glenlivet 12\" , \"Glenfiddich 15\" , \"Highland Park 12\" , \"Macallan Fine oak 12\" , \"Ardbeg 10\" , \"Aberlour 12\", \"Jura Origin 10\",\"Talisker 10\", \"Laphroaig Select\" , \"Lagavulin 16\". For me,Ardbeg is the best,and he made the big impression on me and my friends.Once again,Thanks for everything,i wish you the best.","Very impressive! hard to imagine how big smoke\/peat could be so balanced and refined and yet have some complexity. Palate fully fulfils nose expectations. Smoke\/peat elegantly enveloped with sweetness.  Sweetness is considerably more then half of circle one above. The value for price is fantastic!","This is my Favourite Whiskey for the price! This was my wedding day whiskey having shortlisted a fair few. I''m not going to get into too much detail but if you haven''t tried this yet.. well .. you just have to. Near perfect dram from islay.","Just simply one of the best peated malts in existence! Nice light sweet flavour followed up with a bit of menthol, liquorice and brine. Then an explosion of delicious peat with a finish that never ends. Excellent!","very rich and complex, someky but not overly so, however it can sometimes taste a little too medicinal when you first open the bottle","Amazing. Its pale colour belies the wonderful flavours lurking beneath. A bit more pricey than glenmorangie 10 and glenfiddich\/Glenlivet 12, but worth the extra expense.","An exeptional malt, smokey and very drinkable. It never dissappoints. It also has an exeptionaly long, lingering and warming finish. I''ve allready tasted laphroaig 10 and the coal ila 10, but never was I as satisfied  as  when i finished and dram of Ardbeg 10 and exhaled through the nose savouring the warm smokiness that quiets everything down. An exellent choice for the price.","This is so consistent and is everything I look for in a single malt from Islay. Complexity, peat, smoke, zest and briny sea air. Still my favourite every day dram.","I''m a big fan of Islay whiskies, especially Laphroaig and Lagavulin, but I found this one a little harsh on the palate. Too much peat and smoke for my taste and with an antiseptic aftertaste.","Very smoky with a touch of sweetness and I found a strong tobacco finish which were all good points, however I wasn''t keen on what I got as an underlying taste similar to antiseptic.","I ordered a tot at a wedding bar, it was the only single malt available.\nIt wasn''t to my taste, far too peaty and left a strong smokey after taste for some time afterwards.\nAs they say....horses for course!","one of my favorite","Quite simply one of the best bottles I''ve ever had in the house. So very drinkable, with a gentle start and soft mouthfeel before the length of the drink comes though with sweet and spice until the very end.","One of my favourite go to drinks. Lovely peaty smoky taste but not at all harsh or difficult to drink.","Excellent and very flavoury","Happy Happy!  As a loyal Laphroaig enthusiast, a friend had suggested a new adventure....  Felt compelled to sample this, with Sunday brunch.  It worked.  Still grinning.","Travelling abroad he return journeys were lifted by our in flight whisky. We tried many. It took some time and a little wisdom from others to have a first taste of Ardbeg. Not sweet, and thats great, No taste of wine or other barrel effects. A real beauty of a dram.I always have a bottle now, and prefer it to others that I have tasted.","It's smooth and quite consistently peated, even if not very complex but with quite long taste persistence. It's a great deal for it's price. For this price is quite similar quality as Caol Ila. Just for peat lovers.","This is an exceptionally smokey whisky. A bit too smokey I think, you can almost taste the wood. I like my whisky cold and add ice rather than stones or anything of the sort and if you allow the ice to almost completely melt and the whisky is given 10 mins or so to breathe it turns in to a rather nice dram with a nice gentle smokey after taste particularly if you breathe out of your nose (as strange as that may sound).","Simply the best 10 year old islay whisky.","Just finished my first bottle of this, by far the best dram I've tried to date! The combination of peat and late sweetness is just brilliant. Try it with a little piece of dark chocolate - a marriage made in heaven.  Loved it so much I've straight away ordered a bottle of Uigeadail and Corryvreckan (Ardbeg convert already)!","Tried this one for the first time last night and almost cried.  Lately I have been enjoying Glenmorangie, but this was so completely overwhelming I almost wanted to be sick.  The smokey peatiness so intense it flooded my sinuses and bought tears to my eyes, I continued to persevere with it neat.  Part of me is very determined to try again, more so after reading these reviews, how best may I do this without putting myself off completely?","I've gotten through a lot of diferent whiskeys in my time and I like them all :) well done the scots, the Welsh, the Irish. :))","Just had my first dram. Fantastic. Appearance: light straw color. Beautiful lacing on the glass. Nose: strong peaty smoke. Palate: sweat smoke, light\/delicate mouth feel. Finish: peppery, finishes exceptionally clean. 90 points on my totally unofficial score. Going to pick up some soon.","I'm new to drinking whiskey and after trying it neat, it made the back of my tongue numb, probably I can see why people would like this but definitely put some ice or water in this one unless you like peat. Not my favourite though","Great whisky, deep and powerful with a long smoky finish. If you enjoy the peaty Islay style you will love Ardbeg, if not, you might hate it. We all have different tastes but I feel sorry for people who don't like peat because they are missing out on some of the best whiskies out there. I happen to love it and Ardbeg is unquestionably amongst the best.","Not for babies; this is the Real Deal. I took a bottle of Isley back to a dealer in NYC thirty years ago; I told the man it tasted like shit, like McDonough's boot had fallen in the vat. Well, the man told me to get our of his store. A year later, after I had done some research (sipping and reading) I went back to tell him how sorry I was. This is a Real Man's Whiskey","Excellent 10 year old malt. Big smoke an peat. Take it like a man. Take it neat. A single malt to chew on:)","Anyone who mixes even the most mediocre single malt with iron brew has got to be insane! Really odd thing to do in my opinion especially if you pay good money for a quality malt as I'm sure ardbeg 10 is. Haven't even sampled ardbeg 10 yet but have had most of the other great islay malts including laphroaig QC. Will hopefully be getting a bottle of this stuff soon but won't be tainting it with anything like irn bru; maybe just a few drops of water and that's it!","I thought I really would like this one after all the reviews but it just did not mix at all well with my Irn Bru. Never mind I will put it down to experience and try to find a better malt.","I find that served 'neat' is not ideal for this great dram.  Try half a teaspoon of water to a single or double.  The water will bring forth a great complexity of flavors that are lost at 46abv.\n\nCheers!","It's OK,but I wouldn't call it the best single malt.Would buy a Laphroaig 10yo cask strength instead.","For those not used to Islay malts it is an aquired taste. Once you have aquired the taste just like blue stilton cheese you go back for more again and again.I look forward to this after a hard day working in the garden, and best on a cold night.","I had never had Islay whiskey or even knew Smoke(Peat). 70 bucks down, I poured a dram. Almost cried, the worst smell, taste ever. Is this how it's meant to taste. Then, yes, Then, something happened,I was still thinking about the taste, smell, OMG, I had to get home to try again.  Ardbeg 10, Laphroaig 1\/4, Lagavulin 16,nothing better at this price. Directions:- 1st (2\/3) neat, last (1\/3) add teaspoon water, something magic will happen, trust me.","Exellent stuff, peaty, smoky, bit sweet. I love it!\r\n91\/100.","@Craig, This is exactly what you should be getting from this Whisky. This is Ardbeg's flagship malt, and serves as an introduction to their style of Whisky. This really is a peaty monster, and can be quite difficult to get to grips with if you are unfamiliar with the peaty side of whisky.","I swear I must have a bad batch ... I got mine as a gift ... The color is very pale almost clear, the smell made me pull my head back, and it burned going down, I can't see how anyone could like it if this is how it's supposed to taste, is it the peat? ... I'm used to Macallan, Oban and the generics like Glenlivet or Glenfiddich ... can it be that much different or might mine really be bad????","What a monster of a whisky! It's a challenge but it rewards those that take the risk and pays back with extreme amounts of reward. You really do wake up the next morning still smelling smoke its fantastic. Its amazing that you can continue to enjoy this whisky well into the following day. Truely unique. Its surrounds you and penetrates you, its like The Force. My favorite whisky to date.","I miss my first two drams, which enveloped my mouth with rolling waves of peat and smokiness. I was disappointed that the peatiness seemed to fade once minimal oxidisation took place. There's still a lot to marvel at; it's a tremendously full flavoured and remarkable whisky.","It's the the day after my first dram. I can still taste it","Like one of Willy Wonka's ever lasting gobstoppers this just keeps revealing new flavours as it goes on.  Leave it in your glass for as long as you can and you'll be amazed at the array of flavour that opens up.  The level of peat is a bit like a dare from Ardbeg though!","My most favorite dram. Period.","I agree with the previous anonymous review!","Nose: TCP, burnt rubber, burning coal dust... Palate: it burns like hell... Finish: lingering smell of embers for the next 12 hours or so...\nI will not purchase it again.","Goes over in a wave of lightly sweet golden spicy peatiness, absolutely stunning dram. Truly Islay's finest","A fabulous whisky all around.  If you have mastered the taste then welcome to the king of the peated.","splendid single malt..","Of course you gotta like peated whisky, which I do. This is in my opinion a surprisingly complex whisky for a 10year old. But don't water this one down, it (oddly) takes away the joy of the peatyness\/complexity. A whisky I'll keep in stock","Nothing balanced or light about this beast, gives a strong peat hit when you first swallow it and a massive dose of salt. Takes ages for the salty finish to release its grip with only a hint of sweetness coming in minutes later - or that could be my mouth trying to clear out the salt. This is good if you like a challenge.. Bring it on Ardbeg!!","The nose sets things off well, sweet, smoky. Initial flavour is peaty, rich and creamy but it's also very peppery and bitter. The finish is long; the smoke fades fast but the bitter peppery taste does not and for me dominates the taste overall. I found the Laphroaig 10 smoother and better balanced with a much richer flavour.","The nose sets things off well, sweet","Been looking forward to trying this.. The nose sets things off well, sweet","A beautifully balanced, lightly peated, spicy little number with a spicy, fruity nose.  The taste is subtle, slightly peaty, ever so gently spiced, and a gentle smokey finish. As a non-peat head this, and Caol Isla 12 year old, is an absolute revelation ! LOVE IT TO BITS !","A great whisky, Gets better the further down the bottle you get. For those that dont like it, give if plenty of time to open up and let it get to room temerature, if it is too cold you wont get the sweet creamy counter to the strong peat.","Fantastic enjoyed every single drop :)","First sip found me standing next to my long gone beloved granny stoking a burning pile of wood and grass. Next sip found me in a burning house with intense smoke swirling round my head. This is one hard punching whisky. Long finish with raw dark chocolate as a finale. Brilliant dram.","Good medicine!! Afternoon drink though.","Like entering an operating room on initial opening, but seems to lose a bit of the overpowering antiseptic over several days shelf time. If you're new to Islay malts, Ardbeg 10 is a tough one to start with. Give it a chance and it becomes a decent smoky dram (though not as smoky as Laphroaig 10) with a tad of sweetness and sea air. Still though, feels light overall..needs bottom end. For that try Uigeadail.","The best \"entry -level\" single malt.Silky peaty really enjoyable.With Lagavulin 16 yo and Laphroaig QS my favourites.But Ardbeg a little bit ahead...","@bettieZ: It's better than the Laphroaig 10 Year (not the 10 Year CS).  Haven't compared it to the Lagavulin yet.","Out of all the various whiskies I've had, this one is still my favorite.  Hopefully it doesn't go anywhere : )","Simply stunning, the smoke, the peat, the sea spray.","The TCP comments are simply deranged. I know it's all a matter of taste, but for God's sake! For TCP notes go straight to Laphroaig, which is still a delicious dram.This Ardbeg is beautifully complex with lots of notes that score all over the place (some salty notes on the palate as well as the peat bass, and also some delicious sweetness). Fantastic nose. Just nudges ahead of Caol Ila as my favourite basic Islay.","Nose:  Beautifully strong peat, wood smoke and salt air.  Palate (neat):Starts sweet, mid palate fills with damp wood smoke before moving to drying black pepper and more billowing smoke like a big Cohiba. Add ice or water and the scotch becomes noticeably softer and a tad bit bitter.","Historically, I?m a sherry sl*t and like to stick my old roots, Macallan","exelent!!!","Sat down on Saturday night with a Lagavulin 12, Lagavulin 16 Distillers Edition, and the Ardbeg 10. Found the Ardbeg to be the best balanced of the three. Great Peat Smoke and Sweetness with a Creamy mouth feel. Quite a complex dram very refined. The others are magnificent also and have their own particular strengths but in my opinion the Ardbeg pulls off the balancing act better than the other two.","ardbeg 10 what can i say.islay on its best.a looooooot peat and i love it.one of my favourite whiskys.smooth some sweet fruity.its only one bad thing to say about ardbeg whiskys they are very expensive.but the destillery was closed in years thats why i think.so but the 10 years have a fair  price","Everyone told me that Johnny Walker was the best. Someone brought a bottle back after visiting the UK and I was simply blown away. Amazing scotch! Smokey","Agree this is not for the faint hearted. Non-chill filtered, very gutsy and strong. Don't find it as smoky as other Islay's despite the claims. Complex dram when closely considered.","I'm a Scotch drinking amateur and I just bought my first bottle last night. I normally buy $40 to $50 single malts such as Singleton.  This was $75. I had tried the Supernova previously and that was a mad man.  This is less intense but very flavorful and warm.  It does take a little to get use to the peat and smokey flavor.  I'm glad I bought it and look forward to drinking it with a fine cigar.","I thought there was something wrong the first time I tasted it, a bootleg substitute or a bad batch. Almost took my head off, the intense smell and intense almost medical flavour with a bucket of peat thrown in. Took a whole bottle drunk very sparingly over a year, to get used to it :) To start, sip neat in really small amounts and let the flavour fade away a good while before the next sip. This is one mad whisky which takes some patient perseverence but really worth it.","I welcome its individual taste. I regall as its persistent taste. Drank a bottle (with friends eventually) - will not venture there again. All to taste I suspect.","''Am I mad? I had one sip and tipped in down the sink. Tastes like formaldehyde!Never again..  ''Nail on the head!!.....exactly how I felt, smelt like TCP, tasted like TCP. The worst I have ever 'suffered'....I imagine smokers cant taste it....or am I mad too?","Orgasmic!  Can't go wrong.  Best single malt I've ever had.","This of course is still the 10 yo expression from the previous owners and should be compared to the more recent Renaissance. This 10 yo is still a unique and wonderful experience. Dont complain about uniqueness - the world is full of blandness as it is. Welcome something as individual as this and stop worshipping the untalented!","Very nice. I tried a few drops from a bottle of Bowmore 12, which I think is just fantastic. This whisky is also a really nice whiskey, the main difference for me is that the Ardbeg is actually not as smoky, despite claims that its the smokiest! The smoky flavour doesn't stay on as long either. I really enjoyed a drop of this but I found the Bowmore more...........involving and the smoke lingers alot longer.","Peat, iodine and with prickly heat to finish. If you are in the mood, good. If you are not, horrible. Ridiculously over-rated, but not to be completely dismissed. Interesting. Almost a novelty single malt.","A beautiful whisky.  If you are looking for a quality Islay, look no further. It is pale and complex, but not overpowering.  There is a light citrus, floral quality that raises it above the smoky peat.  I can't understand the TCP comments, only assuming that these aren't regular Islay tasters.","This is a very good scotch!  I had tried Laphroaig 10 Year CS before this, which is another great dram.  This Ardbeg doesn't linger overnight and has an interesting fresh, almost plant-like, aftertaste (seaweed?); very nice.  I was also surprised by the mild citrus that adds balance to the mild saltiness.  There will always be a bottle of Ardbeg in my cabinet.","How would u compare it with the Laphroaig 10yo and Lagavulin 10yo???","My favourite Scotch at this point. Aromatic, huge flavours, great balance, everything you are looking for in an Islay. Wish it weren't so pricey though.","No question, that this is one of the greates drinks on Earth. My personal favourite single malt!","Nose:Massive doses of both peat and honey, tastes very sweet.  Very easy to enjoy, but lacks the masculinity\/depth of Laphroaig.","Am I mad? I had one sip and tipped in down the sink. Tastes like formaldehyde!Never again..","I love it - it's my favorite and what got me started sampling others. I had to look up what \"TCP\" is and had a laugh, but I find Ardbeg highly drinkable and better than a lot, but not all, of its neighbors.","Big Talisker 10","Sat here now 5past 11 at nite and lovein every sip.","Got a CASE!!  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!","After carefully reading the reviews on this site I decided to try this famous Islay malt.Whislt I dont regret the experiment I do regret the expense for the full size bottle in order to agree with other poster that it does indeed taste like TCP.I love the aroma and the smooth taste on the initial drink but the medicinal after taste completely ruins the whole package.Try before you buy.","And now a comment from the US. A great taste with lingering flavor. Ardbeg has become my favorite. Posted by Ternali","This is one of my favorites!!You dont expect all that peat\/smokiness.Mixes well with a splash of water or on the rocks,most excellent tasting scotch","Don't like the taste or even the design of it. Too much tcp and no balance. Good to put on cut knees but I had to water it right down. Islay has so much more to offer !","Exceptional - peaty, smoky, smooth, full of character AND it talks to you as you savour, caress and gently consume it! Its foreplay to a nice dinner!","Ardbeg 10 year is very accessible at its price point and should not be missed by anyone remotely interested in Scotch--A High Quality Dram that is unique and intriguing.","It is just great. Fantastic feeling. Good smokey feel.","This is nothing compared to the Lagavulin 16.  The smoke is there from the get-go but peters (or peaters) out pretty quickly.  If you're looking for full smoke, this is sort of whimpy if you ask me.","Delicious if you enjoy drinking TCP.i have been told that you need to \"practice\" drinking this one from a whiskey expert friend of mine.","I think that is the best malt of the world. And the OSCAR goes to.......","I think, for me, it is how beautifully presented the terroir is that sets this dram apart. It's transportation to the whisky isle.","The pale liquid looks innocuous enough, but POW! this is extremely peaty whisky.  Fortunately it is also subtle, citrussy, sweet, complex and multi-layered.  It's also surprisingly light bodied.  Not many distilleries would make their standard 10 y-o this intense, bottled at a relatively high abv and non-chill filtered.  A connoisseur's dram at a supermarket price.","Too much of the medicine cabinet about it for me- when neat. Some water helps sweeten things up but I travel around Islay for my favourites !","just taken possession of 12 bottles! no, you can't have any, it's all mine!","I love this scotch----smoky, peaty, great character--my favorite of the Islays---Can't wait to try the older ones--","great if you like the taste of burnt kippers","Mmmmmmm Great","great..."],"188":["\nCan really taste the wood in there.

If you love this as much as I do, treat yourself to a bottle of the limited edition, semi-annual 12 yr old cask strength release. It hits all the same notes as the 10 yr old, just way more intense\n","\nA brilliant all rounder. Sometimes I feel like sherried, sometimes peat but always Springbank. This core release is everything that whisky should be. Complex, intense, slightly smoky and floral! A permanent fixture in my collection!\n","\nOne of the best whiskies I think we've tried. Springbank 10 is amazingly balanced and complex with tasty fruit and just enough peatiness. It was tough to find this once I found out about it, as it seemed to be sold out everywhere. Now I'm so glad I found it. I even like that the bottle and packaging is probably the simplest and least pretentious I've seen. No superfluous naming, no exhaustive backstory, just the aesthetics of an old edition of Lord of the Rings and a quick blurb on the bottle about the whisky. Show, don't tell. Delicous whisky, will always be keeping a bottle around.\n","\nOutstanding whiskey for any age statement. Old school for sure.\n","\nOnly 10 years? Very flavorful, perfect balance of fruity \/ earthy \/ smoky just wonderful whisky here\n","\nThis is the crispest single malt that i've ever had. CRISP. Really is the standout adjective for me. Probably a perfect starting point for those wanting a gentle introduction to single malt.\n","\nThis is the best single malt 10 year old expression that I\u2019ve tried. I added half a teaspoon of water based on a recommendation. Forget it. Lemon merengue\/peach cobbler palate. It was absolutely fantastic!\n","\nExcellent whisky. Just bought my second bottle. Highly recommended.\n","\nJust buy it - a perfectly balanced whisky. I thought I knew and liked single malts. This takes it to another level.\n","\nThis year's springbank 10 is one of the most accomplished whiskies I have ever tasted. My bottle has been open around three weeks now and it is seriously coming of age. There is no one thing that hits me apart from its sweet fruitiness which I think Apple plays a role. Sometimes I get a little smoke hit and others I don't, I just love this stuff it is a stunning drink . It is getting hard to get hold of already, bag some while you can.\n","\nThis is superb. Light smoke, coal tar, salty. Sophisticated but also packs a punch. Really distinctive whisky.\n","\nExcellent whisky. Will be buying another bottle when I've finished this bottle.\n","\nHard to believe its a ten year old. With a drop of water and a little time 5 stars all day long. Lovely stuff!\n","\nThis is very unique. Nothing else quite tastes like Springbank. If all Campbeltown whisky was this good, then it's a crime that they're all gone. On the nose there is peat mixed with a salt breeze and some sweet malt. The palate is oily with more earthy peat and some malt. There is some underlying dry fruit because part of this is matured in sherry casks. There is a sharp tang. The finish is long and tingly with a lot of pepper and spice mixing in with the salt. There is a pleasant lingering smoky aftertaste. Very unique stuff. If you are a malt lover in general or like coastal whiskies in particular (Oban, Talisker, Clynelish or Old Pulteney) you really need to try this\n","\nExcellent. Old school\nThe way scotch single mat use to be\n","\nFantastic, characterful, spirit-driven whisky. Spectacularly good value.\n","\nOily, smokey, oddly bitter with a breadth of aftertaste that my palette is likely unaccustomed to. Somewhat disappointing, I feel it would do a lot better for a few more years ageing. Will be revisiting with the 15 YO. Price point seems a little high for the quality.\n","\nThe whisky world''s best kept secret: introduce it to your friends and they will be thankful. I rate it as better than the 15 year old. Balanced to perfection.\n","\nFirst try tonight of this, I loved it! Whilst complex is a very enjoyable dram, one definitely to be patient with.\n","\nAnother excellent Malt, a bit sweeter than the Glen Scotia 10 yr old,,,but just as good. I will buy again!\n","This is superb. Light smoke, coal tar, salty. Sophisticated but also packs a punch. Really distinctive whisky.","Excellent whisky.

Very pleasant dram.","I'm currently trying to invent a device that will allow me to strap a nosing glass of springbank over my nose to allow a happier life. The whisky is fantastic, and for the money I cannot think of anything better than this. 10 mins in the glass and the whisky transforms, give it time and enjoy. It has fruit and spice and smoke, it's oily and briny. Natural colour and non chill filtered 5 star no brainer","Again and again I`ma amazed about this perfectly balanced dram. Strong, sweet with hints of smoke - Springbank 10 always leaves me with a feeling of complete happiness and satisfaction.","Possibly the best 10 YO single malt for the money.","Absolutely loved this...didn't last long. Very balanced, big dried fruit nose, spicey sweet palate with hints of smoke, long finish. Lots here for your money","Now this is a class act! A magical mix of smoke and barley, each complementing the other and neither in charge.

Incredibly morish and a splash of water brings out subtlety. I also get cloves and a touch of cinnamon on the palate a very satisfying dram that I have enjoyed since Iain Banks rated it his number 1 in his whisky book. Excellent!","I have a dram of this as we speak. A very complex, soft, creamy and malty palate.Some touch of orange too.","This one is a food-lover's dream...easily one of the best entry level single malts.Stonking nose...oranges, cherries and a toasted nut I cant quite put my finger on..sometimes a nose will overpromise and leave you wanting, but this is great fun to drink. A bit oily and very more-ish, with a lovely colour; it just gives and gives. It's nicely balanced and great value at 46%. There's lots to pick out on the palate and leaves me with a nice, warm, satisfied feeling inside.","I tryed springbank for the first time last night a fantastic dram. its everything i love in a whisky","I had Springbank for the first time last night. I found it very complex in flavour and I can honestly say that I have never had anything quite like it. At first it struck me as most mysterious but after a few tastes I began to discern notes of heather, smoke, deep caramel, spice  and a wisp of pepper. I sure that there is a hint of wet hound in there as well! Most enjoyable!","Too dry and wine like for my pallet. At times I felt I had a dry white in my glass. Not for me but I can see what others might enjoy in it's complexity.","Michael Jackson believes that Springbank is or should be in every malt lover's top 10.

A fine creamy sweetness of that Caramel at the finish, all the flavours and smells of smoke and Caramel are well defined and separated. Clearly a complex 12 year old and classically Islay. Smoother than Lagavulin and none of the brute force of a Laphroaig. Great value.\n","\nI'm reading reviews which have 5 star assessments and wondering if I just sampled a counterfeit COAL ILA 12 last night at a friend's table.

Big disappointment","For my money this beats the Ardbeg 10.  It's comparable to the Lagavulin 12 but half the price. But I actually prefer this. A super whisky which seems to be getting better while the Taliskers, Ardbegs and Highland Parks disapear up their own NAS.","Looking at the Tasting Notes from The Whisky Exchange and Rocky, I get the malted barley (Shreddies) nose and the smoky notes. On the  palate, for me, a mixture of salty and smoky. Didn't get the toffee and vanilla notes but maybe just a hint of pear. Finish was, again salty and smoky. None of this means I didn't like it. Out of the Islays I've tried so far, my personal favourites are Ardbeg 10 (more than Uigeadail) and Lagavulin 16.  Didn't get on with Laphroaig 10 - too medicinal TCP for my nose or tastebuds. This one, I'd put close to Lagavulin 16 or Ardbeg 10.... but not quite as good.","Very peated on the nose, light vanilla undertones with some floral notes dancing to and fro.\nThe taste is equally complex, light but with heavy notes of toffee and vanilla with a very distinct peated counterpart. however i dont get fruit.\nThe finish is down right amazing, the start of it has reminisce of it spyeside counterparts (sweet and honey) all blending and becoming a very tasteful ashy, tarry and lightly peated finish.","Got this for a Christmas present. High expectations, but both myself and my wife found this to be not to our taste. I hate to say it, but it seems almost undrinkable. Reminiscent of creosote (on the nose), and leaves a bad chemical aftertaste. Is it possible we have a bottle of something which isn't actual legit, or are we the exception, as the other reviews are very good? I like most of the other Islay Whiskey's and have even been to the Island to visit the various distilleries, many years ago. So what gives????","A very smooth and peated dram which is both easy to drink and rich in flavour.","Exotic product with bit sweetness..","Not a bad whisky by any means.. great amounts of peat smoke coming through and a touch of sweetness to balance.. the only thing stopping me giving this more stars is a slight sicky taste.. Butyric acid on the palate.. I know others have found this in other whiskys too.. may just be a bad batch but it just really puts me off personally.","An amazing  dram for those who like a little medicinal, mild peaty note and includes a blast of woody smoke.","An excellent blend of smokie peaty, single malt scotch.  A slight hint of fruit, toffee, and seasalt on the palate and a pleasant smokey finish.","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nGentle peat.  Still smoking, charred beach wood and a sweetness, grassy with a hint of seaweed.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nSalty, cold orange pekoe tea, light peat notes, and smoke.  Think branches piled for a small beach-side fire.  Not overpowering.  Salted cod too.\n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nTart apple, tangy green seaweed, and the final note is salt.  Heavy salt.","Is there such a thing as a bad Islay malt? People tend to dismiss them as either too smokey, too pungent or medicinal. If you love your single malt as I do, you will recognize the subtle differences between different whiskies. This goes for Islay as well as all other regions. Laphroaig typifies the style and can be brutal but oh so rewarding. Bowmore combines the same ppm level of peat with sherried fruitiness. Caol Ila is far more subtle with a lighter body than others. It's hard to imagine something so light in color can be so big in flavor. On the nose it combines wheat with peaty smokiness. On the palate you taste fruit, peat, malt and nice briny saltiness. There is a slight oily texture. The finish is medium to long with the fruit fading fast and the peat and salinity lingering. Great stuff especially if you like variety in your whisky like I do.","Wonderful hit of smokey baconly seaweeds and sweetness that can be enjoyed by itself but for full heavenly experience conjoined with blue Stilton is just unbelievably delicious!","This was a whisky that grew on me a lot. At first opening, not being used to a peaty whisky, I found it a bit full on. But after a few drams it settled down on the nose and palate and I was able to enjoy to its full genius.Let it sit in your glass for a good ten minutes to allow the complexities to develop and enjoy the smoky bacon, and dare I say it, sticking plaster aromas come gently towards your nostrils.   The tasting was light and oily in texture, with a short finish and  it is beautifully balanced between the bitterness of smoke with the sweetness of ripe pears. Vanilla, puff pastry, bramley apples, sultanas, brown sugar, sea salt,  light as a feather... oh my word,  the taste stayed with me for days afterwards, returning seductively, beckoning me back. I shall miss this one , until my next bottle of course...","After treating myself to a bottle of this, it has become one of my new favourites. A good starting point for those looking to try something slightly peaty, but still very smooth and easily drinkable.","A great tasting whisky for any special occasion","Only coming a close 3rd place next to Talisker and Lagavulin.  Great wee dram!","Highly recommended Islay unpeated whisky. Personal taste note: This is better than most of the 15 yrs old scotch.","A very very good whiskey, lots of great notes.  Rich in flavour and a tad rich on price.\n\nI would of liked to give 4 1\/2 stars but can''t.","Exceptional. Right from the nose, it goads your chi to press on. I find the nose smokey, \ntinge of ham and sauerkraut. Certainly not sweet. Leave it alone for 3-4 minutes in the glass and the waft reaches \nyou 15 feet away.

I prefer it to Talisker 10.","An Utterly Superb Whisky. sweet toffee and yes, shreddies on the nose. i love the toffee taste on the pallate and with that subtle hint of smoke this is a real winner","The only dram, that answers all of a real whisky lovers questions, avoids any kind of extremes and shapes that genius composition priced at a level, which gives everybody the chance to have that wonderful experience.","Very very nice indeed! I think I still prefer the  Ardbeg for its extra peat kick, but this has a much smoother subtlety to it! Highly recommend!","Fairly light. Smoky but not quite as overpowering as Laphroaig 10 which it resembles a bit.\n\nI'm not too fond of it because it seems to be a bit thin for my taste. Still, if you're into the style of light-bodied peaty whiskies, certainly worth a try.","A great whisky, one of the best for this price. Plenty of peat but nothing like Laphroaig of Lagavulin. I had a fantastic cask strength 30ish year old single cask Caol Ila at a Whisky Lounge tasting and have loved it ever since.","Very interesting dram indeed. Lovely sweet oily nature to it. Sophisticated for sure. Sweet and dry, some peat, somewhat intense (nothing like Laphroig or Talisker per se). No chill-filtering and no coloring also indicate that this single malt has a dram with solid character.","Yup, like most people have said, a nice way to \"ease in\" to Islay's. A few more unusual flavours with Caol Ila which you dont get with  Ardbeg or Lagavulin - salt, a nice oiliness (trust me) and believe it or not there's a pleasant hint of rubber when you're sniffing!! :) Overall a nice \"left-field\" dram. The cask strength stuff is wonderful too!!","I find the nose has a very clean smokiness about it, not like the big dirty peaty whiffs you get from ardbeg. Palate quite medicinal but more on the gentle side, some citrus tangs and a good load of salt. Finish is a bit short which is disappointing, otherwise a nice dram. Perfect for introduction to those taking first baby steps into Islay malts.","El mejor de Islay sin duda. Un  gran compa\u00f1ero para pasar el invierno.","I have the 12 year old which is a truly great Islay whisky.\nIt sits between Laphroaig 10 and Lagavulin 16 with of course their other southern neighbour Ardbeg. It really is addictive, and although I have 7 different Laphroaigs open, and 5 Ardbegs, its this one I am drawn back to more and more. I have just purchased a Moch which remains unopened as yet. Caol Ila 12 is beautiful - for me this is more and more becoming the definitive Islay malt.Slainte!!","Amongst 12 scotch whiskies that I own (including Talisker and Lagavulin)  Caol Ila is the one I go back to the most often... Next need to try to Ardbeg and compare!","Criminally underrated for far too long, Caol Ila is finally starting to receive the recognition it deserves; easily the equal of its south coast rivals, Caol Ila is second only to Ardbeg in my affections and this 12 year old is a fine introduction to the brand.","This is one of my favourites, a really nice dram...just buy and enjoy and take no notice of those pretentious long winded comments!\nRemember every ones taste is different, but you might like this one!","superb stuff!\nDon't get bogged down in peoples pretentious, arrogant tasting comments about whisky, just drink, enjoy and make your own mind up!","lovely whisky, so smooth, great balance of smoke and peat but subtle with it. Nice warm finish. Easily one of the best whiskies for the money. Excellent :-)","el mejor whisky para los d\u00edas lluviosos de invierno!, al menos para mi. saludos desde Argentina","This has a subtle (weak) nose, is initially mild on the palate and reveals enough smoke in the finish to be recognised as an Islay. However a background bitterness creeps into the mild flavour and is carried forward into the finish. The bitter edge was the taste I was left with despite tasting a few times to be sure. For me the Laphroaig 10 is better.","It's all about the Islays for me and this is one of the best. Probably the most accessible of the smoky ones but don't let that put you off \u2013 this still packs a punch. I like Caol Ila 12 as a slightly (but only slightly) gentler option to my trusty Laphroaig 10","The none too subtle flavour will generate discussion for first time malt drinkers.  it has an earthy and peaty flavour which will catch your throat but then travels down to fire the soul.  This is an early classic in the making, would love to be able to try a 50 year old in a few years time.  Worth the purchase.","My first experience of an Islay was Ardbeg, which literally blew my head off. Caol Isla is more subtle, more accessible and less harsh than some Islay's yet still maintains that smokey peatiness that so defines Islay single malts. This is suprisingly subtle with a faint smoke that lingers on the palate. A good introduction to Islay's.","I found this whisky surprisingly subtle. It is light and sweet in character with some citrus and oak notes in addition to the peat. Quite pleasant.",">Very easy to drink. Smooth. Nice peaty\/smokey flavor. I love it.","As a Laphroaig lover i thought nothing could ever beat my first love.  12yr Caol Ila has sorely tested my faith.  This is a superbly balanced Islay malt.  Without the \"chew the barrel\" extremism of a Laphroaig this one ticks all of the smoky peaty boxes whilst offering something a little wider in the initial taste.  A truly more-ish dram and one i'd recommend without hesitation.

Bourbon lead, but sherry casks here are so bad that they ruin the whole show. So sad, now I don't even dare to try 18 year old.","I am new to drinking scotch and I found that I really liked this.

Superb, I want more.","Excellent. A fine Whiskey. Would recommend this","Love it. Drop of water brings out the best","What a lovely whiskey, I\u2019ll be getting it again.","Unbelievable","A very approachable Islay.  I've had Bowmore 12 a few times; that's another approachable Islay; and one is much like the other in terms of overall flavour.  Where the difference lies, in my humble opinion, is the overall balance and richness of this one.  The Bowmore is lovely with enough smoke in the mix to offer a reasonable alternative to the Bunnahabhain, if one prefers more of that smoky bonfire, however the natural balance here deserves attention.   The sweet richness prevails with just enough smokiness to satisfy and make one tip the bottle again and again.  A little water certainly adds creaminess and a final note of licorice that, to me, is worth the extra price.","This is now one of favourites. Rich, sweet, balanced. For the price, hard to beat. I also  love Hibiki and Nikka From the Barrel.","As good as it gets, I believe. 46% ABV, un-chill filtered, no added coloring. These things matter to me. Price... An outstanding value for what you get.  Bunnahabhain 12 has a lot to offer. Love it.","Any who doesn't like this whisky knows nothing of whisky....this is a standard that others should be judged against..yes there are finer, more complex whiskies out there...but....12 year at this price...come on.....oh and i love the Bottle..it is a Bunnahabian after all...this IS whisky.","One of the last Islays I had yet to  try and I have to say it was fantastic! The Sherry notes are very dominant and it is so unique with its sweetness, and for that novelty alone it is worth a purchase.   It is like a Lagavulin taken to the extreme....\n\nI would love to try a heavily peated version that challenged the sherry a bit more on the nose but for the entry level price there is no doubt it is a sneaky top dram.  A flight of Laphroiag to Bruichladdich  to Bunnahabhain is a fantastic way to show the diversity of flavors possible in the Islay single malts.","Best tasting single malt I've ever had in this age group.  Delicious sipping scotch.","I came across Bunnahabhain a few years ago and was very impressed with it.","Realllllly nice ! I like a sweeter whiskey...just a hint of smoke...no shrill aftertaste and a lovely deep colour to it...which is why I hate the bottle design...looks a bottle of port.Redesign the bottle...I like to see the whiskey through the glass !","I had for the first time .... awesome taste ... had without ice or water ... just as it is ... rolled it around the tounge ... got wornderful taste & aroma..  mind blowing","Smoky vanilla cream with a nice sweetness.  One of my favorites.","A quality dram. It has a lot going on. Sherry, spicey, marzipan, sherried fruit. A wonderful mouth filling whisky. NO COLOUR , although the website says otherwise. A good honest and hearty dram .","Legs are fast. Lack of viscosity suggest a Oloroso rather than PX cask.\nNose - very sweet, dried fruits and some tropical fruits from the longer fermentation with Lactobacilli beginning to dominate the ethyl acetates, acetate esters and ethyl esters, suggesting a wooden washback. Light smokiness from gentle Peating. Slight rubber from feints, despite very narrow cuts 72-64%ABV\nSlightly sulphur possibly from candle in cask. \nPalate - sweet, salty, dried fruits and tropical fruits. Peach, mango,.wood spices detectable but not strong\nFinish - medium, sweet, mixed fruit, Sherried at end.","An amazing rich flavour, stands out amongst other whiskeys","One of the finest whiskies I've had the pleasure of tasting and owning that's 12yrs and at that price.","Another beautiful malt","Great malt. One of my favourites for uner ?40. It has good body palate and nose without the strong TCP hint that you get from some Islays.","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nLight peat, garden fresh mint, piping hot brewed black tea, and a touch of loam.  Sherry lurking in the background.  Sherry?  Yeah, in an Islay malt?  I know.  Bewildering, but more about that later.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nSpicy dark red fruits of plum, Moroccan dates, figs delivered courtesy of aging in fine sherry casks.  But, this is not simply a sherried dram!  The sherry notes are lightly peated.  The peat action is not your usual over-the-top Islay blast but rather evoking pleasing dry, flint-like, weathered beach stone, graphite taste.\n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nSweet malt lingers with oak, tarragon and rosemary.  Wet wood beach bonfire smoke too.  A faint echo of peat.","Seriusly great malt! This sherry-matured islay malt is one of the Best whiskies i have ever tasted. I give it my highest of recomendations. The sherry isn't a overcoat or overpowering in any way. Simply a compliment to the malt itself! But watch out, there seem to be sine problems with the 12yo in the American marked (they seem to be of pour quality). But here In Denmark, everything seems to be just fine (quality wise). Sl?inte!","Disappointing...inoffensive but lacking in any distinct flavour.","Lovely and smooth with a hint of peat but not overly so.  A lovely whisky to sit in front of a roaring fire with.       To Mr A. Hunt - I imagine you're taste buds have been shot to death with cheap low grade alcohol","A thoroughly plebian product. Low-grade rotgut, with a hint of peat smoke, nothing on the phenol count, and a rough body. Hints of cork and dirt, marginally more palatable with water.","A good price and very different taste compared to other Isley whiskys out there. It's not the smokiest of its kind but one that has an iteresting yet pleasant taste about it. It's a good one for the collection!","Scotland my haim - as is bunnahabhain the only drink for me - (please note it is whisky wi' out the 'e') A fine point, but this is to fine a malt to be called 'whiskey'.","Just my taste - smooth, rounded and a hint of smoke","Makes for a wonderful dram after a long days work. A few drops of water really unlocks it, and it is a fabulous introduction to the Islays for those (like myself) who are used to Speysiders. The hint of vanilla smoke and sea salt beg for this whisky to be enjoyed on a rocky shore in the cool autumn.","For the price, you can't beat it! One of my favourite whiskys A beautiful smooth scotch with a creamy smokey fruity texture and a fabulous long finish. Just buy it and try for yourself.","I love the Bunnahabhain 12 year old!!  Every time I fly and land in a good duty free shop (the ones in USA - SUCK!), I look for the Bunnahabhain.  \nIts just a touch smokey but so smooth that it will make you want to slap your.....(insert whomever).   I was introducted as the lowest peaty level scotch on the market.   I love some peat just not anything like Laphroig or the like.   To me B gets me both worlds a bit of peat but not so over powering that kills the experience.","I basically blind tasted it.  I got coastal with fruit Blackberries.","I''m writing this in the wake of my mother''s passing last night at The mighty age of 92. Sitting in her study after an evening with my 3 sisters reminiscing, and sipping this 12 YO,  which I bought to open with my bro-in-law because my surname, Hain, makes up a third of \"Bunnahabhain\". A world away from the old 12, and reminiscent of a dry sherried Speysider with added seasalt. .   I call this the \"Islay Mortlach \"  and pour myself a third, or is it a fourth?","About as good as it gets for the price. If you like the tasting notes of course. If you are looking for peat, there is none to be found.","what i like is the lightness of the smoke, even though i prefer more smokey Islay''s this has something special.\nits a wonderful whisky and well worth the money","Amazing cream and vanilla notes, unlike i''ve ever tasted. At 46% this really has an impressive finish, very long and smooth, spectacular. Make this bottle last and you will not regret buying.","For a 12 year old (and I''m not saying whiskies that aren''t 21-29 years old are inferior by default...I simply mean compared to others in the 12 year age class)-- this simply doesn''t get any better, only different. I''m an experienced and well read whiskey enthusiast, and know that 1st hand experience is far more valuable than reading tasting notes (so go buy one!). I use 3 palatting techniques (critical to experiment with!). I pay attention to what foods I eat might subtly affect a particular whiskey I sip even an hour or more after a meal, I pioneer food pairings as well...I''m no noobie, and I say that this is perfectly balanced, perfection in a bottle. About palatting techniques (briefly), find a very, very dry whiskey, and experiment with different palatting techniques until you can make it taste sweet-- because whatever flavors might be revealed in doing so, will only be enjoyed IF, you do so...experiment with various ways you sip, and swallow (never gulp even a small sip! Swallow it in 2-3 miniature intervals while palatting). Yes, that was the brief explanation, have fun learning the rest :) This is the best era Bunnahabhain has seen in a decade, I appreciate the fine attention to detail from this distillery lately-- it''s never been better in my experience. Looong finish for a 12 too! Highly recommend even to those weary of Islays. :)","A superious staple whiskey. A decent, affordable whiskey to be enjoyed at any time during the year. Always have one in the cupboard.","This one''s a great entry level bottling. It won''t rock your world unless you are fairly new to single malts but the quality is consistent from bottle to bottle and the taste has no flaws.","Smooth and silky. Tastes great and goes down a treat. To be honest it's the dog's.","Introduced to this malt on my recent visit to Edinburgh for hogmanay. Just returned from a rugby weekend with a bottle under my arm ! My new favourite","New favorite and saving up for a bottle.","I think it is one of the best single malts I''ve ever drank great smell and as smooth as silk well done to the distillers and to the people who watch over this stuff","This has usurped Highland Park as my new favorite 12 year old. This has as nose you can get lost in and a taste to match. Superb.","New favorite","Came recommended so my daughter bought me a bottle for my birthday. so glad I trained her right!! Hope I get another bottle for Christmas!!","My first ever Bunnahabhain but not the last one, that''s for sure. I was quite excited about this one since I''ve heard good things about the new Bunnahabhains. And I was not disappointed at all. I was supposed to just have a taste and when I opened the bottle I ended up having 5 glasses. I highly recommend this fine Islay single malt.","The best unavailable in Ontario, Canada","Very simply . . . delicious!  \nI''m a Highland Park 12 lover and this is very, very close.\nCan''t imagine anyone not liking this superb whisky.","Oh yeah, this it good :) no two ways about it !","Great value, and I've even managed to make steps in my mission to convert the mrs to the delights of single malts.\nA smoky, peaty dram that definitely hits the spot","I was given this whisky as a present, from a region I tended not to try (assuming it was going to be peaty, which I detest) and from a distillery that was new to me. I was so surprised and pleased with the flavour, which alighted the senses. Gentle on the tongue and a beautiful follow through taste. Magic. This is a whisky to sit and enjoy with some good friends.","Bunnahabhain is an outstanding Scotch producer and their 12 Year Old Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky is a reflection of this very fact. There is yet not a single Bunnahabhain produced that lacks balance, complexity, integrity and so forth, as their line of single malts are all masterpieces. The 12 Year Old version which is no color added and un-chilfiltered is just another spectacular single malt, very distinct in the way of being full of character, a lot like what Ardbeg.","Was introduced to this single malt this weekend at a music festival. A female friend sampled the half dozen scotches available and decided I would like this one the best. She was right (she chose a Jura for herself). I plan to purchase this in the near future.","I've always said that much of whisky appreciation is down to one's own personal palate. This, in my opinion, is outstanding. Sweet, full bodied and clean tasting with a gentle warmth. If angels' tears could be distilled this is what the result would be.","this is fantastic whisky the extra strength(46%)  the non chill filtration and no added caramel make for an excellent nose and taste sherry, choclate ,nuts ,brown sugar and no peat which is not the norm for islay.\nOut performs alot of more expensive whisky.","Further to my previous. I have just got back to drinking this and it has an outstanding taste. I will not be without this one.\r\nI would rate this as outstanding in its class\/price.","An absolutely fantastic single malt. The taste experience makes it superb. This is a drink anytime whiskey.","Not sweet, very smooth and very good. It is not like other Islay malts. I would recomend this to drink anytime. The aroma is not strong but the taste is great.","Got two years ago just opened it. Slightly peaty taste not overpowering. Slight sweet flavour. I give it an eight out ten for experienced scotch drinker.","New to whiskey, what with trying Glenfiddich, glenmorangie and glen livit. Have to say that this whiskey is fantastic. Plenty of flavour with an awesome after finish. For the price, it's a corker.","This slightly stronger malt has a greater intensity to it yet does not overwhelm the richness of the flavour.  Whilst it doesn't have quite the smoothness of the original, it is by far one of the best and most drinkable and enjoyable malts I have ever tasted.","the only whisky I will drink, superbly smooth and full of flavour. This is something special, keep it hidden at the back of the drinks cabinet for special friends, or when toasting your toes infront of the fire winter times.","This is a outstanding whisky!, plenty of sherry influence and peat and vinilla notes, don't take any notice of the malt snobs out there that rattle on about what \"real Islay\" whiskies are, just because it doesn't taste like a bonfire doesn't mean you're not getting an authentic Isaly experience, after all it's distilled on Islay and you're not going to get more authentic than that.","I was introduced to this whiskey 19 1994 by a friend and loved it since - it was one of the few whiskeys I never get bored of drinking !!","Recommended this by bar staff at the Kilmartin Hotel, Argyllshire last week. Smooth, gentle on the palate, yet with enough edge to declare its Islay heritage. Looking forward to the bottle my wife has ordered for my birthday.

Great dram for reasonable money.","Appearance: Bronze. Nose: Sherry, coffee creams, toffee. Palate: More sherry, mint coming through, after eights, dark chocolate, brown sugar glazed bannanas, Armenian brandy. Finish: Non-chill filtered fist in a very velvet glove. Surprising tasting notes for an Islay Malt! Really enjoying this new bottling.","Finally picked up the new bottling; a vast improvement.","Very different than the older presentation, but quite similar to new 18 yo. Much more sherried than I expected, but lightly salty and seaweed like Bunna is still there. Excellent stuff.","It?s a wonderful whisky! But buyers beware! Do not expect this to be a typical peaty islay. It?s the most unpeated islay whisky your likely to find. So if you?re looking for the finallic peaty blast, look elsewhere. But if you want a quality whisky, that?s different from your Highland Parks or your Glenfiddichs  with creamy vanilla, golden barley, luminous, tart, sherry, and a big salty maritime nose. Then look no further malt mates. Highly recommended!!!!","It reminds me a bit of Glenfarclas 15 YO on the nose, but the taste is definitely different, me likes!","My wife got this one for my birthday, nice surprise. Great aroma, great taste, nice colour, in other words, great whisky.","A bargain.This is how it should be bottled a different dram to the previous offering,Really enjoyed this whisky full and long,looking forward to the new 18 yo.","Bunnahabhain has come home, superb! and Garry I suggest you go back to whisky school, there is more to Islay than smoke and peat, Blasda anyone?","Honestly, expected more from this,the aroma reminds me of the cheap Black Bottle,but fortunately the taste is better; still nothing like a real Islay though, and a bit too spirity for 12 years old, I know it's 46% but still other scotches are smoother at such ABV. If you really want an Islay,get Lagavulin or Ardbeg, in NYC they come at almost the same price.","Super","Received a bottle for Christmas. I had heard this \"latest launch\", with it's non-chill filtration was good, but I was taken aback by just how good it was when I finally tasted it. Beautiful.You may note that on a cold day this whisky may look a little cloudy, this is due to the way it has been filtered and is perfectly normal, even desirable.","I have the old bottling...rather boring.  I am very curious to try this improved version!","Agree with the above comments. What a difference,this is now a wonderful bottle of  whisky,up there with the best of the islay malts.","This stuff is non-chillfiltered and has \"Natural Colour\" (i.e. no caramel added), and is bottled at a decent strength, instead of the normal 40%.  And the results - as you would expect - are fantastic!  In recent times the 12yo has, to my mind, been a flat, lifeless thing... but this new bottling is bursting with life and flavour!

Lasanta is more traditional and overall more satisfying for me.","Aaah Glenmorangie, you have won my heart. Decadent, sweet burnt sugars, butterscotch, spice, oak, orange, faint peat.

Lasanta is one of the best Whiskies you can buy for under $100.","Needs no more than a rock or 2 of ice, I've been searching for another single malt finished in sherry casks and not one has come anywhere near this,  truly a drink of the gods.","Yay.  It's fabulous.  Nose: drying paint (oil-based) with a hint of spruce charcoal and smoked Loch Ness monster jerky.  Mouth feel: warm, plush and blanketing.  Palate: honey-tinged  bird droppings, burnt metal and smoked polyester.   Finish: fired butterscotch, warm vanilla bean... long; and sherry!  I do it every time for the Finish!  Awesome.

Wonderful nose , smooth but with a kick.  You will finish the bottle before you try another.","The best of the four 12yr old expressions. It's the woody\/nutty finish that does it for me which is delicious.

Still, a real winter warmer. Very good!","Very smooth and easy on the palate, especially with a drop of water. Wonderful stuff!","This one tastes so different to the Original Glenmorangie. it has a deeper aroma like dark chocolate, nutmeg, caramel and cinnamon. In the palate you can taste the sherry and a little bit of smokey citrus flavour.\n\nI would say that it is a little bit complex and even harsh un-diluted. I would recommend to have it with a splash of water as it will unlock its full flavours and aroma, improving its smoothness.","Nice smooth finish!","wonderful","\"Nose\": Limes, oranges, raspberries, fog hanging over a bay, and brine of the sea in the air.  \"Palate\": Powerful arrival of sweet sherry!

Look elsewhere if you are sherry inclined, maybe Balvenie Doublewood, Auchentoshan 3 Wood or a young Macallan. If you want a quality Glenmorangie at a good price go Nectar or Original.","This is a great allrounder. I'm more of an Islay or Talisker fan myself but I keep a couple of smoother drams as well. This is one of the best with a good nose, a brief kick as it hits the centre of your tongue and a fantastic sweet lingering after-taste. Don't think just buy it.","At first, I found the overiding taste on the palate to be a strong flavour of sultanas \/ raisins, I presume from the sherry casks used to finish the maturation process for this fine whisky. But after a few more single and double measures I grew to like it very much. Typical Glenmorangie..very rich, complex and alluring, and definitely as smooth as it says on the bottle. I'd definitely recommend this one purely for its quality of combined richness, and smoothness.","Nose: Sherry! Sweet, honeyed barley, dark Chocolate\/ slight liquorish bitterness perhaps, slightly briny, some slight sweet pine wood notes.Palate:  Immediate sweet barley arrival. Heather honey, dark taffy, barley sugar, not a liquorish but a chocolate note that starts as dark chocolate and then turns to milk chocolate, sherry, all hit your palate at the same time and all are beautifully woven together.

Coastal malt should be a category to itself or at least a style that gets more recognition. Think Oban, Old Pulteney and Talisker. This fits in well. On the nose you get heavy malt mixed with fruit and sea air. The palate is really interesting. The mouthfeel is oily with a lot of fruit, salted caramel and spice. The finish is unique as well. It is briny and drying with a waxy feel. There is so much going on here. Heavy malt. Salty and sweet. Nice spice and fruit underlying. I highly recommend this stuff. Put less into blends and more onto the shelves of liquor stores","Lovely stuff. Salted and honeyed caramel","Very complex exceptionaly crafted single malt although its only 14 years old. In the nose salty and floral, the taste is a burst of saltiness with spices and of course young flowers combined with a hint of smoke a hint of peach\/green apple skin and a bit of bitter wax. Aftertaste kinda medium. A trully great single malt.","Well worth the price.  Just something different and quite interesting about it.  Quite light, not too full bodied but plenty going on in your mouth.  Would have another bottle.","I am not an established authority such as Jim Murray or Serge Valentin but I know my single malts and hence I am well aware of the very fact that Clynelish 14 is a fantastic dram with distinct personality and it is possibly the best value single malt in the 14 YO segment, along with The Arran 14, of course. Well done, Clynelish. Strongly recommended.","An absolute cracker of a whisky.  I can't add to the descriptions already put forward by previous satisfied customers, but I will say that this is a coastal beauty.","Patience... Give this one a chance to 'open up'.  When you get this one home, have a wee dram.  Periodically over the next 6 months, have another to assess any changes.  I found that its esters will eventually reveal themselves quite nicely.  This one (like Dalwhinnie 15 and Glenmorangie Original) requires patience.  Alas many a bottle has been consumed before its such time and a surprisingly quality whisky undiscovered.","This is a delightful malt, more comparable to Oban than Genfiddich 15, i.e. a class above. Just a touch sweeter (yes, honey) and less salty on the finish, very classy. I cannot find a criticism at this price, but if I wanted to be picky, i'd say that the finish is a little short and (like Oban) I would have liked to taste it at higher strength, given it's smoothness the alcohol is barely noticeable.","A good whisky to leave for waiting. Probably it's an autumn dram, smooth coastal malt for the smooth september.","This is good but not as good as I expected; has a floral nose a rounded flavor and and doesn't burn to much going down. Very slight hint of smoke but honey?? nope. OK finish but didn't leave me wanting another. It's comparable to a Glenfiddich 15, not quite as smooth but a better initial taste. Maybe I'll try one of the 90's when I sober up.","This has a sweet and inviting nose with hints of plumb. The body is smooth and warm, fading to a salty finish. My one complaint is that the finish is a little short.","A bold Northern Highland Single Malt with a unique mouthfeel. Honeyed and fruity, but also slightly smoky and packing more than a decent punch at the end. The \"coastal\" nature opens up nicely with a drop or two of water. While this 14yo is great for its age, I wish there were more reasonably priced official bottlings of Clynelish. 8 out of 10","Really impressed by this, lovely briney, smooth sippin whisky, not one of those that burns its way down, this just glows and lights up your evening.","I think it smells like honey and citrus peel, tastes like buttery flower petals, and finishes a bit salty and smoky.  This is such a nice introduction to scotch...  It will be my go to bottle when my friends wise up and ask to know more about this fabulous hobby.","I would agree with Mikko, Jason's, and others here, so I can't add a lot to what they've said on the specifics, (although I'm not getting the chocolate of Derek Wheeler's description). However, I can say this is an exceptional find. Shows a clean pair of heels to several better known (and much pricier) single malts.","A very nice waxy, full, fruity mouth feeling. The peat stays in background as a heavy artillery. The waxiness is a trademark of Clynelish. It's a very unique character, no longer seen in single malts today. In perfect strenght of 46 -% this is what single malts are really about.","This is a fantastis single malt!  Age statements are not necessarily indicative of quality and Clynelish 14yrs is proof of such a proposition.  I'd put this up against many 18yr old single malts and there is not a shadow of a doubt that the Clynelish would come out on top!","simply superb nothing else to say","Wake up Herr Botha and try and express yourself a bit better. Maybe some malts are too complex for you!","The best recomendation for this is that this is a base for a JW Gold Label","A fantastic single malt, the riot of flavours is just awesome - much better than the likes of MacAllan or Glenmorangie and other better \"marketed\" brands . Wish this could be made available at the duty free shops at Delhi, Bangalore and Bombay airports.","There's a lot going on in this dram. A superb aroma as you take a sip, then the flavours race about your mouth one after another in quick succession. A slightly astringent quality hits your tongue as you swallow, leaving a warming finish of chocolate, peat and woodsmoke. Talk among yourselves; I'm off to get another...","I read all of the above. Wierd mix, if you ask me. Honey, brine oranges, burst fruit, caramel, sea salt. For God's sake people. This is only a very good whiskey. Stop all these nonsense pompous descriptions which are only supposed to boost the ego of the taster!","Classic Northern Coastal malt. Pale orange colour and full sea salt nose. Starts with touch of orangey sweetness and has a medium long finish of spicy pepper. A unique malt from a treasured distillery and a superb bargain at this price.","Spicy, caramel scent with smooth overtones.  Nice single that sips great!","Had this recommended by one of the fine fellows in the Whisky exchange.  Robust, warm and spicy, yet with the gentle peaty, smokyness I was after.  Very, very moreish: I'm having a tough time making it last, had to buy a couple of other malts to do so.

I don't know all of the fancy words to describe it but it was the nicest I have tried so far.","This is my first attempt at a single malt.  In my amateur opinion, Clynelish has a full flavor taste with zero bite or burn.  I now know what all the noise is about.  Though I will now try other brands, Clynelish is the name that I will remember as the single malt that got me into quality whiskey.","I was given a very generous measure of Clynelish last night. This is by far the most yummy , easily sipped, single malt I have tasted  very mellow to start,followed by a flavour of burst fruit and finally the much appreciated very warming glow very moreish!!","One of the most pleasant surprises I've ever had when trying a new single malt.  The stronger than expected bitterness on the finish was a bit of a surprise at first, but it contrasts brilliantly with the rounded sweetness of the initial taste, and I very quickly came to appreciate this expression on its own terms.  Will no doubt appeal more to those who prefer a more full-bodied, upfront, single malt."],"225":["\nRises to your nose first with a citrus sweet aroma.

Im half Scottish and English.  But I swear to my ancestors that this is the best ever!!!!","I cannot discern all the tastes that some others describe with such precision and  clarity.

I love single malt Scotch and this is among the best I have tasted.","I am a typical peat head so I wasn't expecting to be too wowed. This is a very good speyside.

For those of us that collect and drink scotch but can't afford 300 dollar bottles, this is one of those drams that needs to be in the cupboard. It's not the greatest whisky around, but it is very good and very smooth. Vanilla and fruit abound. Not a lot of depth to it, but a fantastically easy drinker at a very nice price","Amazingly sweet! And great value for money too. Love the floral notes. Very easy to drink with tastes of fruit, apple, pear. Lovely.","I like very much i worked in 1975 in Blandy brothers in lisbon Extraordinary for me","Very good","Smooth, sweet and delicious.","One of the best single malt's of Speyside, superb balance and finish, sad too see it decommissioned in the UK.","Smooth, great finish","Beautiful bouquet, the body is a smooth and inviting.Slight floral scent and citrus comes through at the end.. alcohol is a little lacking in the mix.","I never thought I could be a scotch drinker until I ditched my go to bourbon and tried this stuff.

Not smoky at all. But good option for killing a bottle with friend :)","Finest Scotch whiskey I've ever had in my life.","I don't know what it used to be but I had 3 bottles in the last year (2016) and it's just an average whisky now. On nose, vanilla and green apples. On palate, honey and apples. Development is negligible. Finish is unnoticeable.","If you take honey and add it to immature spirt this is what you get.  Thank god I got a free dram.  It's still better than mass produced american spirits though.","Amazing and smooth, mild smokey taste with a complexity to the flavours. Slight taste of orange and peach. The bartender made a mistake and accidentially gave me a glass of this, and I fell in love with it instantly.","A smooth single malt. fruity with a touch of orange and a slight smoky taste. The finish is long, and has a nice warm feeling.  Great for a cold winters night!","Smooth!","Smooth and tasty, easiest way of describing it, a great whisky for someone new to the spirit","I just received a bottle of this for my birthday. This is the first single malt I ever tasted many years ago before I graduated from blends. While my tastes have since grown more sophisticated I can still appreciate how good this whisky is. You can find it in every liquor store in America and on the top shelf of most bars. It deserves to be there. In my opinion you will discover better malts as your tastes change but there will never be a better introduction to the world of single malt scotch whisky","I am used to drinking blended Johnny Walker Black.  Until now that is. This is the smoothest scotch I've ever had.","A smooth whisky with an inner warm satisfying feel of contentness","... it seemed too malty at first. After I gave it three more tries, I sure noticed some more tinges, but couldn't get rid of this \"beerish\" trace. Is it what experts call \"sweetness\", I just wonder :)","A beautiful whisky.  Delicate and smooth. The nose is sweet cream and almonds, definitely pear.  On the mouth...honey, vanilla and toffee with a bit plums.  The finish is mellow. Not intense but very satisfying.  The toffee lingers. Warm with a subtle taste of buttery biscuits.  The Glenlivet is exquisite and is simply the genuine article and should be expected in any public house or bar in any good town or borough in any country or state.","Not every scotch, in order to be great, needs to be some psychotic smoke-bomb from Islay that leaves one feeling like their drank liquefied fireplace. Glenlivet is a fine Scotch, bright and inviting, with some pronounced floral notes on the nose, and a gentle smoothness. Scotch snobbery results in missing out on the full spectrum of what scoth whisky has to offer. Give this one a try - affordable, welcoming, delicious.","Nicely priced. A bit of a beginner''s single malt to be honest. Light, vanilla but not very distinguished. It''s a good solid whisky, but didn''t give me a \"special\" feeling.","I am so disappointed with this product. It''s finish and flavors were not even beating usual blended whiskeys.","The best nose, palate, aftertaste and kick! What else should I say?","Swave!!!","Smooth and flavoursome.","Splendid.","Mellow delivery with a heavenly kick!","First time trying this whiskey. Generally I''m a cognac drinker but tonight while at the bar this bottle of Glenlivet 12 just kept staring at me so I tried it. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. This is a damn good drink.","Sometimes a lighter, smoother whiskey is desired and when it is, Glenlivet 12 fits the bill. I enjoy all ranges of smokiness in a Scotch, but not all the time. Glenlivet 12 never disappoints.","Frankly I''m a bit disappointed with Glenlivet 12yo, its mellow and light, but simple and almost tasteless.","This maybe great for beginners but whisky enthusiasts do not approve. Very plain and simple, an industrial standard single malt.","I received this has a Christmas gift from a good friend. And as soon as it entered my mouth I just knew that this was a very, very good whisky. Thanks you very much and I will be buying it again.","A Scotch I actually enjoy more with ice. Typically I will add a few drops filtered water to my whiskers, but actually I find the Glenlivet 12 to be too harsh this way. With a large cube of ice, suddenly the liquor is creamy and of tart apple. Very curious.","No doubt as soon as it touches your taste buds you will know this is quality and smooth, cannot imagine it being better with a longer maturation.","I really like the sweetness of Speyside whiskys and this certainly doesn't disappoint.  Colour is bright with shimmering gold. Nose is of a summer meadow with ripe fruits. Palate is again ripe fruit wirh fresh but sweet notes. Could perhaps be a little smoother for my palate. Finish is long with hints of fresh coconut and a hint of almonds.\r\n\r\nFor the price and age this is a lovely dram. Like I said could maybe be a tiny bit smoother on the palate but nothing to really gripe about and I'm probably being rather picky! Maybe competes with my favourite Old Pulteney 12 - although they are very different whiskys !","Fairly new to this whisky lark, I'd been avoiding paying for the more common malts, wanting to get a taste for the more unusual, and so I imagined, the more interesting. However, I picked up a bottle of this cheap last week, and now all I want is more of it. It's delicious. You can drink it neat as a warming nightcap or with a couple of ice cubes if you're after something a bit fresher. Ice, rather than spoiling it, brings out a different taste altogether. Very, very impressed.","Great whisky, great value. With all its history it is still the malt to beat. I would recomend it without reservation.","Very creamy and fruity, somewhat complex. Very pleasant drink without doubt.","A great whisky at a great price. Very approachable.","A very nice drink indeed, no burnt barrel taste and no taste of peat. A very nice smooth whiskey.","Plain and simple indeed, but I like that cocoa-mint-cream nose.","It's a great entry single malt however I find it rather bland compared to such as bushmills 10yo and singleton.","Great Speysider for the money, plain and simple.","Got to be one of the best Speys going. Sure, you can try lots of other malts, but i bet you will be returning to this one time and time again. Georgious. Much better than Glenfiddich IMO.","Optimises the standard in everything I look for in a Speyside single malt, just drink and enjoy. Creamy and smooth, subtle yet rich-underlying flavour, however not too subtle that's it's watery - just perfect. Always provides for me a bubbly happy level of tipsiness.","The floral explosion definitely sells this one to me, it has a very distinctive flavour.  I'd highly recommend it!","As far as 12 year old Speysides go, I prefer Linkwood 12yo (though it is also more expensive).\nGlenlivet 12 does have those flowery, malty dryness notes. But definitely no peaches and no vanilla. If not for the lovely warming finish, this would have been a little disappointing.","I cannot believe someone thinks JW black is better than this! GL is a malt of the highest quality. Try the 18yr old...sublime!!","Once upon a time, my love of Bourbon convinced me that I would never like the taste of Scotch of any type - full stop. Until that magical day when I opened up a bottle of this that my girlfriend had been given as a gift many years ago and hey presto! - my taste buds were conquered. A lovely drink that you will never know if you do not try.","1st time i've bought this and impressed.  coming off a few of the islay single malts this was a pleasant change.  very smooth with plenty of sherry and not too much of the malty dryness.  a fan!","I see what you mean, Richard. Glenfiddich is more fruity and 'ripe' on the nose than the Glenlivet. It also has a slight touch of smoke, which is absent in the Glenlivet. However, I find the Glenlivet more complex and ultimately a bit more satisfying. They're both really good though and deserve their popularity. Keep an eye out for the Glenlivet 12 First Fill - it's better than the regular 12.","Voicing the many others I'd have to agree on the nose. Flowery and vanillery ( if thats a word) . It is smooth and easy to drink. It leans towards a floral taste, yet its mildly sharp, bitter and acidic. It's not a bad tasting 12 year old but there are better options out there. If you are going to buy a 12 year old Scotch in this price bracket in opt for Glenfiddich....of course its all subjective.","agree with most of the above, those who like it, that is, the glenlivet 12 is a classic speysider, period.","Not really a Speyside fan but got bought this for my birthday last year and it's certainly not unpleasent.","Probably ideal for people new to whisky or those who dont enjoy stronger flavours.Just in case Jason (further up) scared anyone off, dont worry, this whisky isn't chewy, it is indeed a liquid.","Beautiful  whisky. simply the best thats all i have to say","`First Single Malt I Tried...Smooth and enjoyable.. BUT I am also tasting Johnnie Walker Black. To me JW Black Label is so much better,especially for about the same price..","Bought it on offer for 20 quid, not too bad but after trying Ardbeg and Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban and Lasanta I would rather spend the extra few ponuds and buy any one of them. Pretty standard stuff and nothing to rave about.","Standard top shelf fare that should offend no reasonable palate. I grew up drinking this and it still oils the wheels of business for me.","One of the first single malts I tried (of many); The Glenlivet remains one of my favourites to this day. No need to over analyse it, just drink and enjoy all it has to offer. An enduring classic.","Great taste, smooth and easy drinking.  No hangover at all. Posted by: Deepak","Palate (without water\/ice)Medium bodied, chewy, dark toast, cinnamon rolls, fresh bread, a little apple, and plenty of dark plums.Finish (without water\/ice)Fresh ground pepper on the finish with gentle sherry notes and a maltiness that hangs on the palate for quite a while.","Very good whiskey, similar to Glenfiddich 12 but better as this is not quite as fuity so it doesn't mask the oak flavor.","Very sweet beautiful caramel, florral, vanilla","Sweet and juicy with a long, fruity finish. An enduring classic.","Great introductory single malt. You can't go wrong with this for a great value whisky. Yes, florally, vanilla on the nose, soft well-balanced palate and smooth","Enjoyed this malt,very impressed by its complexity,smooth to drink,floral on the nose with hints of vanilla and maybe a subtle burst of chocolate,all the same a very nice dram.","Very smooth and easy drinking. I'd say the aroma is more caramel\/vanilla than flowery, but that's just me.","A touch of water can release more flavour i agree. Just don't put ice in it ! A fan of this but lacks big enough flavours for me i go elsewhere for my thrills ...","One of the best things I've ever tasted. Rich, smooth and gorgeous. A real classic.","I purchased a bottle of this over ten years ago and am drinking it as I type. Its as smooth as the day is long and the flavour is excellent.","A classic never disappoints, do not let others say thisis not a challenging single malt. It is consistent andelegant in flavor ...no need to look further, its perfect.","The proper way to spell it is whisky, the proper way to taste it is with half a teaspoon of cold water,,,,","Lovely whiskey and very smooth but, for the same money, I'd recommend Glenfiddich or The Balvenie.And don't we all drink whiskey neat???","I had some of this whisky and it's taste was very pleasant, smells like a combination of fruits the the finish is warm and somewhat dry but you can taste it's full flavor in the finish, very good whisky for the money. I drank it neat.","Fantastic for the money, very rich and flavourful.","Complex aperitif whiskey, with a fragrant nose and incredibly smooth finish.

At first I almost went back to cognac's since I like the sweetness. My first introduction to Scotch was The Glen livet 12, and 15, which were okay. Than the McCallan 12 (and also 15 I believe) which were also just okay  as well. Than GlenMorangie 10 year which was a bit too mellow and fruity for me, not very complex. Then I found AUCHENTOSHAN THREE WOOD (which had no indication as to how old it was) this is THE CHAMP!!! This is the best cognac like Scotch, yet more complex with better and more variety of flavor notes. I won't go into all the different flavors, it seems to vary among different individuals. All I have to say is if you like sweet and malty notes (among others), rich and complex, but smooth with just enough bite, this is it.  Thank You Auchentoshan now lower the price a bit $58 for 750ml makes me limit my consumption. Five Stars.","I like it.","Has a rum like smell, nail polish remover, thick chocolate ganash, sherry, green apples, blackberry, toffee. Smooth on palate, no real after burn.

It''s something that both of you can enjoy.   After many trips to Scotland, this is something we both enjoy together!  We will order many more bottles.","Where  have you been all my life .........?    As a big follower of the Islay's and the Macallan's  this was an unexpected Christmas present. It tastes great, and full of high sherry notes and long after tastes of thick dark  spicy chocolate and hazelnut, very slightly bitter at the end, but that's probably a personal note, which is what it's all about any way.  Very impressed.","I'm fairly new to whisky but this was recommended and was by far the smoothest I've tried. Dangerously so, as one painful morning revealed. It's not stopping me buying another bottle, though.","Unbalanced and awkward dram with particularly strange notes on the nose. Not what you would typically expect from Auchentoshan. I don't understand this Three Wood expression winded up with multiple gold medals, maybe the bottle that I purchased was bunk? At any rate, after finishing a bottle of Laphroaig Three Wood, this was a major disappointment. I guess you get what you pay for...","So is this a 12 year old then? The guy in the shop said it was a 9 I believe (I know, that is rare).\r\n\r\nGreat aroma and aftertaste, very smooth I miss a heavier body though... Could this be because of not being quite and old whisky?

BIG sherry, Big cream, SUPER sweet. if your not into any of those profiles, stay away, if you DO LIKE them, well, your in for a real treat. Definateley a desert scotch as the PX does wonders for this malt and it is one that I'll continue to stock.","I am lucky to have about 70 different malts to choose from, but for a winter warmer by a peat fire this is the one.

Just opening my bottle now.....","HH Blair: They don't list an age, but it isn't a particularly old whisky a far as we know.","How old is this?  Cannot find references to age.

I would definitely recommend it but to me its drinks like a younger malt with some sharp notes which are exemplified by its coastal salty character. (Perhaps this is just my taste, but i do love talisker and the islay salty malts) By all means give it a go but i probably won't be buying another bottle\n","\nBrillant! A wonderful single malt. A deep complex taste,smooth and very different to other single malts I have tasted. Recomended.\n","\nI Have tried several single malts, there is usually no single malt that I don't like, all different, all with your place in the world (except those who for some reason comes with a strange taste of throw away, as has happened to me 2 times, some people have already commented something like taste of sulfur?). However there are some of those that emerges in our list of preferences for its quality on the palate, clean and flawless, with a sequence of flavours always with the malt flavor that I really appreciate. With Arran 14 I don't feel flaws, but a good balance between the flavors (that I don't distinguish), with pleasant spicy and a slight effervescence, always with an excellent malt flavor. I think any fan of whiskey will not be indifferent to this arran 14, and some will find here a top whisky.\n","\nNose: oak, vanilla, malt, little caramel in background. Palate: Ligfht and creamy. Oak with sweet spices, choco-caramel with little malt. Finish is quite long; starting sweet, then spices kick in and dry finish. Nice dram. Much better with water!\n"],"266":["\nBeautiful dram but a little less so than the longmorn 16yo. Fine flavours,clean but distinct and complex. I really rate this whisky.

Big thumbs up from everyone.\n","\nExcellent whisky: 46%, non-chill filtered, full of flavor for the right price.\n","\nPurchased this from the Whisky Exchange as a drink to enjoy over the Christmas period. I had a small dram immediately and my mind is blown by how nice it is.\nThe tasting notes are pretty accurate but that underlying profile of port with the high ABV envelop you in a luxurious warmth as it slips down your throat. This is very much a drink in keeping with the winter and festive season.\n","\nMy favourite of all the port cask finished single malts. Very smooth but bold with chocolate and orangey notes.

The flavor lasts an extremely long time.","Beautiful whisky, elegent taste, quality","Exceptional whisky, just amazing, ultra smooth, deep  flavours, 10\/10.","Nice","Cask finished whisky has never been my thing.  Even though I prefer big peat and\/or sherry maturation, I have a soft spot for the Glenmorangie 10yr original because it is the first single malt that I ever had.  While there are some of the nutty banana flavors of the 10yr present, this stuff is completely different.  In the glass it almost looks like rose wine.  On the nose all I get is fruit.  On the palate there is some spice (nutmeg?) mixed with the fruit.  This is not the fruit of sherry maturation.  It's the kind of sharp sweet\/tangy that was present in the fruit punch I loved as a kid.  The finish is sweet and of medium length.  The port is always present throughout.  Overall, this will do nothing to make finished whisky ny favorite.  That being said it's good unique stuff,  that is a nice change of pace from the Islay, coastal and sherry matured whiskies that I love.  I recommend that you give it a try, if you haven't already.","To experience the taste notes, you really have to place it on the tip of your tongue. There is orange, raisins and bit of spices.  I thought the smokiness could be improved to increase it a bit more as that would have balanced the sweetness of orange. The sweet aftertaste of orange and raising is a bit overpowering and does injustice to otherwise a great malt.","Not everyone will like the idea of whiskey with a slightly sweet aftertaste.  With products such as Jack Daniels Honey becoming popular, these drinks seem to be in ascendency. In my opinion, Quinta Ruben is one of the best.","It has a gorgeous faint ros? hue that is bright and clear. On the nose it is floral and fruity, with red berries, honeycrisp apple, watermelon and an allusion to cotton candy. To taste it is quite thick and rich, with a little bit of heat on the tip of the tongue; a sophisticated integration of wood and wine-soaked fruit leads to a long finish with a subtle mint note. Perfect after dessert. It's excellent.","Very fullbodied. Perfect for man company.","Lovely rich flavor.  Sweet, but not cloyingly sweet.  I typically enjoy a bit of smoke, but didn't mind its absence in the Quinta Ruban.  No hint of astringency at all.  Finished very smooth.  I kept going back for more which was disappointing since I only had a small taster from a set.  I will definitely pick up a bottle soon.","Fruitcake, Christmas spice, bandage, raisin, sweet decadent caramel, thick & syrupy, oak, buttery. This has been my number one Scottish whisky. THE Scotch that got me into scotch.  Even when I got my hands on a bottle of Nectar D'or and I first opened the bottle, QR won. Now that Nectar D'or has sat for about 3 weeks, it has officially settled down and became the nectar that I imaged when I bought it and has officially surpassed QR in taste\/aroma. However, you can't beat the quality of QR for the price\/availability. It is my favorite Scottish Whiskey, and will forever have a place on my shelf.","\"Nose\" (undiluted)\nOrange peel, dark chocolate, faint hospital bandages with medicinal ointment, and freshly turned over, early morning, damp earth, as you hunt for worms for that fishing trip.\n\n\"Palate\" (undiluted)\nRich, velvety, mouth filling body of loganberry, blackberries, raspberries.  Think Christmas fruitcake with lots of chunks of dark plum, raisins and dark cake bread.\n\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nFantastic finish.  What started initially as sweet quickly became mouth watering, and then dry and by the time you swallow, you are left with dusty apricot and port wine notes.","Color: deep and thick gold red. Style: m?dium body and richness without smoke. Nose: full of diferents berries and port wife notes. Palate: sweet and thick. Full of port and diferents berries notes mis and asociares of Orange.\nVery good expression of the port Cask extra mature.\nFinish: great and prolong port wine notes and a little nut taste. Very good Single Malt Scotch","I doubt that there is a scotch or Irish Whiskey under $300 that I haven't purchased a bottle of or at least tried at my whisky watering hole.  There have been many a dram sampled above that price range in the last 3 years.  Without question, and by far, this is the best of the bunch.  I love the Macallan 25 year old Sherry Cask, but it doesn't hold a candle to this diamond in the rough.  It won't be my sole whisky on the shelf.  I'll have a Redbreast 12, a Midleton rare, a Balvenie 12, and this bottle.  I'll say this though, I can live without the others if I run out.  I will not wait to run out of this bottle before buying another.  There will always be a full bottle waiting in the wings.  This is the only bottle that I take so much care in insuring availability to myself and my guests.","First tried this scotch when it was called Glenmorangie Port...Loved it from the first sip....With water and ice, this scotch goes down smoothly...proven by myself and friends... As stated by others, this bottle seems to empty itself !!","I find the port, spices and a lot of youngish wood (pencils, vanilla), but this malt is way too short on actual malt notes IMO.","Just poured my final glass of the bottle, my grandfather and I have gone through this bottle a lot faster than planned. This is a very morish dram with a sweet nose with a hint of berries which is also present in the taste, a hint of vanilla too. The palate is a bit watery in texture, sweet and slightly spiced with a slight burn, a touch of dried fruits with orange peel too. The finish lingers just enough to leave you wanting more. For the price I would highly recommend to anyone wanting a drop of something different and to feel like you are drinking expensive scotch without breaking the bank","I have to agree that the kick is something one needs to aware of. Otherwise, a fine,aromatic Single Malt that often goes unappreciated...","Love it. First bought a\"baby bottle\" of it at the Edinburgh castle in Scotland. Have been hooked ever since.","For those who like to taste their Scotch, beware the first sip; it''s got a bigger kick than most in this range. Later sips bring out the nutmeg mostly, less so the raisin and there is no hint of orange here.\nStill, a fine, hard Scotch one needs to be careful with. I use ice here where I would not usually do with others, including Glenmorangie''s 10 y.o. standard.","Very nice indeed. Love the burn. Freezes the mouth for a few moments after a hearty swallow.","I love this.  Best one out of the Glenmorangie group.  Best $40-50 scotch you can buy","Not normally a Glenmorangie drinker but picked up a bottle of this on special offer at the supermarket, very impressed indeed. Wonderful nose and very very smooth indeed! Definitely will buy this again.","A superb whiskey, you can just settle down with a bottle and let it empty itself, the depths are fantastic and very smooth and warming","As a newcomer to Whisky i was bought a Glenmorangie Original for xmas and am now hooked. So now ive got a bottle of this, loving it only trouble is these bottles seem to leak as they empty rather quickly.","I bought a bottle of this just before new year (from a supermarket sadly, but only because I had a gift voucher). I opened it as the film \"Avatar\" was coming on, and settled down into the film with the bottle within reach (which we all know is a rookie mistake). The whisky is sweet and divine, far better than the Lasanta in my opinion. You can keep your 3D glasses; I recommend the Avatar Quinta Ruban version! It made my new year :-)","I have to agree with jorj. The nose is stunning. Turkish delight and...Christmas, basically. Chai spice. \nTheres definitely a very faint, almost unnoticeable hint of Fresh hospital bandages and sweet orange peel.\nQuite different. Short burn, Wonderful long aftertaste.

Anytime ,Anywhere, just a great warm,and heartfelt hug from Scotland.","This one has had a lot of praise but I dont think it's as smooth as some make it out to be. The nose is something very special though. Let it sit in the glass for about 15 minutes, then instead of sticking your nose right in, hold it just above the glass and gently inhale. Nutmeg and turkish delight. Beautiful.","Different. nice, one you should try but not the best. definatly worth the price","Sublime. Close your eyes - Christmas in a bottle."],"270":["\nExtremely well balanced, the nose is impressive and fruit forward, the finish comes closer to the Islay spectrum which is my true love and completely different than any Speyside I can remember. The overall body is full and satiating like a good beef stew. This really does touch all the bases. I thought it lost a little of its gusto after adding water but that may be just me.\n","\nOpened my first bottle and what a delight. Lovely hint of sweetness and rich warmth. Will savour this one!\n","\nA delicate presence of apples and a hint of pears, which comes out more with water. Sulfur, sulfur-smoke, prominently. Tiny bit of garlic. Little bit spirity, I will say, even with water added. Takes one teaspoon just fine, but not much more than that. Careful does it. They say this has a meaty character to it, but I would say it is *bready*. Specifically, I get bread *sticks*. Kind you get in restaurants. Touch of olive oil.\nCanned fruit cocktail fruits, red ones, yellow ones. Pineapple, passion fruit. Tangerines, grapefruit and pomegranate. Orange peels. Yellows and mellows with time in the bottle. Reminiscent of an unpeated Caol Ila. Gooseberries, apricot marmalade, cream, vanilla sugar. Cloudberry marmalade and thick sweet sour cream (a combination I tried in some pancake roll ups once. Delicious.) Frozen yogurt. Sassafras root. Ginger. Molasses, rum-like. Dense waxy malt. Malty. Chili note. Cocoa powder, dusty cocoa. Bit bitter. Classic style dry seltzer water. Mineral. Old oak, in the background, like oak furniture sitting in a house built in the 1800s. Walnuts. HONEY, natural and pungent, unprocessed. The sulfur tones ever so slightly down and marries with the caramelly fullness of this dram with aeration.\nAll in all, a very very interesting dram. The fruit is a little less pronounced than I'd like it to be, and it *is* slightly spirity, but the overall presentation and uniqueness of this dram takes it up to a 5\/5 for me.\n","\nSimply excellent. Like a basket of fruits thrown at your face, followed by gentle smoke and more fruits. Amazing, simply amazing. Very different from most Speysiders, but not in a bad way.

Definitely a smooth, easy to drink whisky.","Awesome Scotch, smooth sweet to spicy finish.","Salty and smoky nose. Fruity and salt on the palate, with hints of cereal. Good length. One of my favourite everyday drams.","A fantastic, smooth to taste whisky","Oh dear.\nThis is a soft, smooth, sweet & slighty smoky single malt.\nOnly one thing disappointed me.\nThe added caramel. \nFrom the very first nosing I detected it.\nIt put me off what could be a very fine malt.","Really good. Smooth. Some citrus notes. Give it a try","Excellent n really smooth drink for any occasions and makes one feels really nice with its tingling taste","Only been drinking whiskey for a few years. This is by far the best single malt I've ever tasted (so far)... Honey on the tongue before the spice hits. Sweet and smokey after. This whiskey is incredible. Only giving four stars because I haven't tred a ton of single malts. However this whiskey is superb!!!","Sweet honey nose, oily mouth feel with some fruit and spice, finish is mostly spicy with a dominate mineral note on the finish. 85\/100","Fantastic; especially for the price range. Warm honey dominating the nose is amazing.","Wow! So so impressed with this whisky! I was recommended to try it and sceptically brought it on offer, and I have to say I think it is a beautiful scotch! Such depth in every mouthful, lovely sweetness of figs, honey and some stewed fruit, and a touch of smoke too. Anyone wondering weather to buy a bottle or not don't think just buy! You won't regret it! Brilliant stuff!","An incredible find , subtle tones with personality . Really enjoyed this wee dram . A must try","This bottle had been in the cuboard for the 15 years since my father died, this Saturday I thought it was about time I tried it. I usually drink Laphroaig or Mortlach but found this very palatable and will now have to finish it off.","It's the first whisky I ever tasted\/bought.  I've tried many other brands after that. But I always return to Oban 14 year. It's the one I drink now. It's the one I have to buy in between whenever I have been brave to try another brand. It's the only one that I until now can say is really wonderful. It's the one I always look forward to drink a glass or two of on Friday night after a  busy week in the office.","my daughter bought a bottle of this for me, when she couldn't find my favorite, Tobermory 10, but boy what a malt, will definately buy myself one when it has gone! 10 out of ten.","Smooth single malt. Probably the best that is out there today in this price range. Highly recommend!","Smooth single malt. Probably the best that is out there today in this price range. Highly recommend!","If you think this is pricey for and entry level whisky, there's a reason for it. Perfect balance of honeyed heather, malt and fruit. As far as the fruit goes figs are very prominent which I find very unique. The is a slight hint of peaty smoke on the finish which I guess is because of this distilleries location. The perfect balance of a classic highland malt and the islands. I highly recommend it","Smooth like chivas regal. 18 years","Elegant heather honey, citrus and spice, smoke and peat not overpowering.  A fine sipping dram with a bit of good  water.","Delicate, not heavy or peaty although I like those attributes, a fine mild scotch.","This dram is delicious.  Enjoy it neat.  Not a bit harsh.  It''s just the right amount of complex without being cloying.  The smell of honey, oak and citrus is mouth-watering.","A bit to fruity for my palette . Pleasant aroma and start. Finish is tangy. Although it has many flavor hints. Prefer a more smoky drink","I was, to be honest, rather disappointed with this admittedly fine Scotch. For the price, I think I was expecting something a little more over the top...yet Oban tasted really not much different than most lighter scotches I''ve tried. Lots of dried fruit, wood, but nothing that made me say \"Wow!!\". Don''t misunderstand - it is by no means bad in any way...just was expecting something a little more I think. For Highland scotches, I''ll take Dalmore or Glenmorangie any day over this, and for much less $.","The finish to a perfect day.","My first real Scotch. Its smoothness makes it easy to drink, especially for those who aren''t used to Scotch (and expect it to be harsh), and its fruits, vanilla, and sweetness make it enjoyable. I find women really take to Oban for these reasons.","I might be unsophisticated, but Oban is the best Scotch I''ve ever tasted.","Damn I never felt the smoky finish but it was a bit flavorful at the finish since I am used to blends. My fave being black label. As a single malt I enjoyed it. But it will take me some time to really figure out its ambiance.  But I like it so far so 4*","We all have fond memories of our first true love. I tried others, but Oban 14 is my go to for enjoyable sipping for the price. I''m ashamed to say I''ve spent 4x the money and was let down. Money isn''t everything.","Pleasant smoky aroma. You can taste the salinity of the sea and a burst of spice.  A simple dram that I enjoyed but definitely feel there are other options to consider when dealing within this price range and age bracket.  Don''t feel I''ll explore this again but am happy I did try it since other I know have enjoyed this bottle.","A decent run for your money.  Subtle and gentle with the peaty smoke which is balanced well with the overall notes of fruit and salinity.  I actually enjoy the smoke in more peaty bottles like the Lagavulin 16, but if that does not suit your palate, than this is a good choice.","Perfect balance of sweetness maritime influence andlight peat smoke. A good long finish I do not notice as much smokiness as other reviews which suites me \nas not a lover of heavy smoked whiskys. Just bought DE\nof Oban looking foreward to trying it","a nice complex whisky ..  for the money probably the best deal going.","underrated and delicious.","An instant rush to the taste buds, with a low level finish which is soon over. A very individual whisky of medium body, quite pleasant, perhaps a little overpriced.","The first sip changes every second--very, very complex.  An almost perfect combination of smoothness, brine, citrus, vanilla, peat and smoke.  To my mind, a quintessential Highland malt.  Superb.","Took a tour around this distillery, and a very fine tour it was, even found out that the distillery came before the town and picked up a wonderful Oban whiskey glass to boot. However, the highlight of this tour is certainly the tasting at the end where you get to sample this whiskey in its various incarnations.\nWonderful drink.","Hands down the best 14 YO Single Malt Scotch regarding quality-price ratio in the market, not to mention it is bottled at 43%. Superb!","Very easy drinking with a hint of smoke. So far, one of my favorites.","I gave my wife a glass of Oban 14 year old her response was\nthat was nice.","Amongst the most prestigious Highlanders and possibly the best single malt scotch for the price!","Had my first taste last evening, nice really nice!","I got my father a bottle for Father's Day which, of course led to a sample! Nose: Sweet honey heather with a whiff of smoke followed by salty sea air.Palate: Sweeter than I expected- lots of honey, heather and more honey leading on to a salty sea breeze.All in all it reminded me a lot of my own bottle of Dalwhinnie, but a very decent malt that transports you to the nearest habour!","I'd say more OH-bun.","It is not OH-BAN but instead it is actually pronounced OH-BIN","Amazing! Im in love with this whisky. The girlfriend bought me a bottle here in New Zealand, problem is the price down here","If Tim is a young malt drinker, then I am probably an infant at 32 years. I don't possess all the necessaryterminology, but can say that Oban is one the most finest drops I have ever enjoyed!Glenmorangie is great (esp. matured in Cognac or Port casks) and so is Glenfiddich. Laproaigh is great, too, but too smoky to be enjoyed in larger amounts.It's true, Oban is very smooth, great pleasure to drink!","Being a young Malt drinker (50) this is the best of all. I don,t like the TCP taste of other malts and I find this perfect. whaat a dram. Thank You Oban","I'm sorry, but i just cannot find much fruit. And it tastes kind of stale..  just don't undenstand all the praising here. I enjoyed Glenmorangie and Dalwhinnie quite alot and i like fruity and smoky whiskies, especially islay, which this reminds me of somewhat.. but i can't just get my head aroud it. I usually agree with most of the comments on this site, but this one; I just didn't like I guess.","There are others that capture the attention with more gimmicks but in terms of allround beauty this is as much as anyone could ask for - particularly at the price. One to have on permanent supply...","I always enjoyed Oban, but never as much as this latest bottle I got. It's truly divine, perhaps the best scotch that I ever had. Variety is the spice of life, but if I had to choose one bottle, it would be this one.","I've been an American made whiskey drinker for years with the occasional scotch. I tried this wonderful drink and now i'm hooked. I would encourage any one to try this.","Pronounce it  with the emphasis on the first syllable as in OH-ban. Gorgeous malt! Honey and citrus tones and a hint of smoke with spice...gorgeous!","Sorry if this is a stupid question, but how do you pronounce it?","This is a fabulous dram, smokey oranges in the nose and a very thick, creamy palate!Finish is awsome with kinda citrussy mamalade finish. My mark is 9\/10.","Oban tastes good. Goes down easy. Not as much smoke as I had expected. Tastes expensive. I only tasted it once, in a bar. The one little gripe I have is that it tasted flat or pre-aerated. But I liked its rich flavor.","I have been an Oban drinker for years. It only gets better. My only problem is that I go through 2 bottles a week and sometimes I can't get it in my area. Hopefully there will be no problems in the future buying it.","Palate (undiluted)Initial warming of the mouth as orange, lemon zest and spiced honey waltz across the palate in a sensuous fashion. Smooth whisky but with spiced honey that keeps it interesting. Pleasing like the warmth of the sun upon your face in a Florida orange grove.Finish (undiluted)Glazed brown sugar chaperoned by soft, slight wafts of peat and turning to smoke. The lingering smoke and peat couple to produce a semi-sweet tang offspring.","My god this is fruity! very nice dram indeed.","I am reasonably new to Whiskey but this is one of the best I've tried. I would also say it is a lot better than some of the more expensive bottles on the market.  Great value and worth a try!","A drink that speaks for itself - You will not tatse a better single malt at this price!","Yes this is a lovely drop of gear, smooth without being bland,as good as it gets at this price.","one of the best single malts i have had the pleasure of drinking. smokey,peaty and very smooth nectar","Very well balanced and smooth.Has hints of brine and smoke with some peat but is subtle and strong at the same time.Marvellous."],"274":["\nMy son introduced me and my wife to the pleasures of Teaninich when he brought us a bottle for New Year and we are happy to continue the enjoyment despite being only occasional drinkers.\n"],"275":["\nII found this whisky and bought it partly because of the great price, partly because of the of the great reviews I read.

There was definitely the thought that too deep a nose-full would knock me into unconsciousness deep enough for a full gastrectomy. However, I took the plunge but only half finished my dram and left the glass on my study desk only to discover it again two days later. In that time a miracle had happened - not water into wine but industrial antiseptic into an exceptionally delicious whisky: mellow and light as a fairy's kiss. To my mind this simply shows that you distillery guys are too impatient and over-fuelled on testosterone. It is no good having to pour a dram a day or two before consumption so please, please, please, you Bruich boys, age it longer in cask and handle it with kid gloves ... then you will get many more people coming back for more.\n","\nA very nice Islay whisky with some gentle smoke. It would be amazing if they were able to age this for another 8 to 10 years.

Cereal, Leather and mushroom, phenols, popcorn, rubber, inside of a tea pot, all from the feints in the spirit.\nSlight vanilla and caramel, but not a lot of wood spice from lignins or lactone from the cask, suggesting a second or third refill American White Oak.\nPalate salty as expected from an ISLAY, distinctly oily, mouth filling, cinnamon ginger and nutmeg detectable in palate and finish, which is medium to long.\nA good alternative to Ardbeg, but not as fruity, as Ardbeg has very short foreshots only 10 mins.\nGuaiacols rather than medicinal or antiseptic Cresols suggest a lower combustion temperature of the peat.\n","\nThe sweetness of the barley nicely offset with a good punchy finish.

I would not reccomend this to someone searching for the \u201ctraditional Takisker Smoke\u201d, but on the other hand I definitely think Tali fans should try it, just as I have.\nNose- Dried Fruit, Cherries, Light Honey, and a minuscule note of brine, and even less smoke.\nPalate- Port right off the bat, followed by oaky- earthy flavors. Brine, and a hint of iodine and smoke.\nFinish- smooth, sweet, and savory. I almost didn\u2019t want to swallow it. Cherries, Port, a very small amount of brine. Almost a tiny hint of bitters which complimented the rest of the flavors, although the bitters could have just been in my head. Mild-warming feeling going down, extremely satisfying dram that can be enjoyed by all Tali fans. There\u2019s no doubt it stands alone in the Tali line up, but there\u2019s a reason for that. Tali produced a dram without the pepper and peat for their consumers who weren\u2019t a fan of things like that, but as someone who drinks Octomore without even a dash of water, Tali Port Ruighe is not only a universal dram, but an excelllent dram for all scotch connoisseurs. Final note- it does not have an age statement(NAS), byt leaks from the distillery say it\u2019s 7-8 years old, which is fine by me. I\u2019d reccomend this to everyone who enjoys Tali to experiment with this, and everyone who are not high peat scotch drinkers to pour a dram and share it with the friends and family. Worth the money 5x over.\n","\nOrdered this because my father loves Tali 10 and I enjoy scotch aged in Sherry\/ports casks.

Cracking year !\n"],"299":["\nThat good I bought 2 more\n","\nThis was the best whisky I have ever tasted. I\u2019ve tried a lot of them and this one has just the right balance of smoke for me, alongside a rich quality taste and smell, exhibiting all the right notes - leather, old barrel and all that business. The 57% strength doesn\u2019t make it too strong to drink and adding a drop of water exhibits an entirely different character altogether. Don\u2019t nose it for too long, just dive right in and quaff it. 10\/10.\n","\nOverall it is a great scotch. It's complex with the smoke, surprisingly not alcoholic even though it is 57% ABV.

Lovely!\n","\nSo smooth and lacking in taste I'd rate it as something to get drunk on rather than savour. So it's dark, shall we give it a round of applause? Trying to ascribe notes of flavour to it requires more thought to try and discern something, anything, than I have either the time or patience for.\nI have a bottle of Highland Park 12 year old here. Let me pour a dram. Ha, ha, ha! If the Highland Park rates a ten, this Beinn Dubh rates a minus 3. It's awful. Made for swanning around socialites, I'd say. Still, I'll have to lie to my poor brother who gave it me just to keep the old family relations on an even keel.\nSpent a week living on the old Ardbeg Distillery manager's house back in '93 when it was temporarily shut down, got the tour of Islay distilleries with him to introduce me. He had a few personal bottles from a Bruichladdich special keg bottling that was the best malt I ever had. Ridiculous. That distillery was also closed at the time, a bit of a low point for the malt whisky industry. Then it got popular for the hipsters and all these distilleries re-opened, and there's enough special bottlings to drown a sinking ship, which rather strays from the original point. It was ever thus when an industry becomes over-commercialized and over-hyped, forgetting the point. So this Beinn Dubh seems like an opportunistic run at making money to me, as an ancient purist.\nBeen through just a few malt whiskies since 1970. This Beinn Dubh is a convenience malt made to profit from the burgeoning trade of people thinking they're going to be whisky connoisseur experts among their friends, I'd say. Sorry. Young, not stated age Glenfiddich is superior and pretty near machine-made judging from my visit. 100 proof Glenfarclas from the friendly distillery not far away is ten times the liquor.\nDear oh dear.\n","\nJust sipping a wee dram of this in the Carindow Stagecoach Inn, Argyll. The manager has told me how to pronounce the name twice but I still can't...anyway. Black treacle in colour with great thick legs, typical speyside cakes on the nose. A moderately powerful burn on the palate. Rolling the liquid around the mouth intensifies that burn revealing no further flavour than christmas cake with a hint of plum. A little milk chocolate on a lingering finish.\nOverall its ok but not great especially considering the price of the bottle which is in a price bracket that coule buy 2x superior budget bottles or any number of better bottles in the same price.\n","\nFantastic worth ever penny\n","\nPleasantly surprised been enjoying my national drink for a number of years now aged 70 will notify friends who wish to know what I want for Xmas future birthdays to get me Beinn Dubh leave the amount up o them\n","\nUnique experience you must know your whisky to fully appreciate it\n","\nTotally underwhelming. The bottle speaks of dark mystery, the price promised a quality dram but my overall experience was disappointing.\nThe nose was a cross between toffee and Christmas cake, the taste was slightly bitter brown sugar and molasses.\nThis didn't last long on the palate, even with a dash of spring water.\nAll in all, a bit of a let down. I won't be revisiting this one I'm afraid.....\n","\nThis is a rich and flavorful whisky. It is fruity and spicy like a good Christmas cake. A bit pricey, but for special occasions, a nice treat! Purchased my first full size bottle after picking up a sample bottle on my last trip to Scotland. Definitely will order again!\n","\nI originally bought this just for the colour. Indeed, a colleague initially thought it was dark rum!\nMy first impression wasn't great with a slight vinegar-y smell although that may have just been me as I didn't get that all the time.\nFlavour wise I get raisins and sultana with a slight spiciness.

I thoroughly enjoyed Macallan 18 Until the jump on price made it very difficult to continue enjoying. Then came mac 12 double cask. Delightful. I shade lighter than Mac 18 At a third of the price. Recently a magnum came on the market which was a pleasant surprise\n","\nThis is interesting stuff from Macallan. The usual Macallan rancio sherry fruit is kind of in the background behind the spice from the oak. There is also a butterscotch\/ toffee like creamyness that is mentioned in the producers\u2019 tasting notes. This is not quite the sherry bomb that the Macallan 12yr sherry oak is. As far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s the real Macallan. I think it\u2019s worlds better than the Macallan fine oak series which they wisely made to appeal to current trends. I\u2019m a relatively young whisky drinker (41). However, when it comes to scotch I\u2019m pretty old school. Sherry or peat (or some combination of the two). Personal preferences aside, this is pretty good stuff that is worth a try, especially for experienced whisky drinkers like me who think they\u2019ve tried it all.\n","\nJust perfect, IF you like the Sherry ones tjis one is really a bargain! Smooth and rich flavour and not to sweet!

Its interesting to taste what two extra years in the cask does to a whisky. On the nose you get the same raisin and spice profile that you get with the 10 yr. On the palate you really notice the difference. The 10 yr has a strong malt presence with sherry in the background. This 12 yr has strong sherried fruit present mixed with nutmeg and cinnamon spice.

I live in NYC and I believe this is only available for export. I've only ever had the 10 yr previously which is a fantastic entry level whisky. It's similar to the 10 but with more age. It is slightly darker in color. On the nose it has the same raisin and spice as the 10 yr. The palate is not quite as malty but the sherry presence is stronger than the 10. Strong sherried fruit, with honey and nutmeg and cinnamon. The finish is long and warm with the fruit and especially the spice lingering. Apparently they use casks from a very dry sherry which is what to me makes this whisky so unique: the sherry presence is just as strong as other whiskies, but the dryness stands out.

It''s flat flavour is just bad it is over sherried and shows if the quality of the previous barrel owners sherry and not the whisky. It''s just over powering the whisky flavour and not letting through any of the best characteristics you get of a Fiddich in all their drams. I have tasted sherry monsters before and love them but this has no depth and you can''t even tell what type of sherry was used as the amalgamation of the flavour doesn''t carry through at all. I tried adding some water and they was a little of that vanilla honey banana caramel Glenfiddich charter coming through but adding more water just dround out and diluted it to the point of it been undrinkable. My view is this is not worth the money and your money would be better spent on a different Fiddich finished dram and that I''m so disappointed and also if I wanted some sherry I would buy some sherry but I wanted a whisky finished sherry and not a whisky that shows of the sherry if you get that !\n","\nNice, smooth sherried \"wedding cake\" theme like Akis pointed out.

I won''t repeat what has been said regarding nosing and tasting notes. \nThe only observation k have is that the nose, for me, is almost like a strong perfume. I added a little water to calm it down. Addi a little water also allowed the fruit notes, typical found in the Glenlivet 12yo to come out.  I must say that I enjoy the 12yo a bit more than the 15yo.

I've not got the experienced pallet of some reviewers, but I fail to see why anyone would rate this. There are much more interesting 15 year old Whisky's than this and Glenfiddich 15 is one of them.

Not available in USA so enjoyed a rare bottle brought back by friends visiting the UK.","This is one of the truly outstanding whisky's available at a working man's price. I haven't tasted as many as jim Murray but have sampled several dozen over the years and am happy to agree with him that at worst it is superb and my bottle seems to suffer from rapid angel sharing whenever I have one.","Considering that some malts are so heavily peated it's like sipping a bog,  some of the negative comments here are just plain daft. If, like me, you tend to put turf on the fire, rather than in a glass, then this is a very agreeable whisky. Yes, it's heavily sherried and definitely not for the afternoon or early evening, but serve it up after dinner, and there'll be no murmurs of dissent from your guests. As they say....\"horses for courses\".","There is sherry and it is overt (so far so good), spices, vanilla, orange on the nose.  The palate has a full rich mouthfeel and exotic spices dance around malt with sherry, vanilla and orange marmalade.  It's a big boy and big is beautiful. A little less oaky finish could be ok but some nights, that oak transforms the whisky into something more than a savoured sipper, it becomes a party animal draped in colourful robes dancing on the rooftops. Lighten up, sherry up, give it up.","I tried this bottle on the strength of Mr Murray's 'Bible'. From now on I will decide for myself. I found this far too sherried and of no distillery character at all.","Absolute superb single malt.

Mr Saxon needs to get the message. I also find the 15 yo to be spoilt by sherry influence.","I think Mr Lathwaite needs to root his dictionary out. Just check 'Disappointment'. ;) I'm really quite shocked at how divisively this one splits folk. To return to Mr Lathwaite, I tried this very early on in my malt experience and it was only coming back to it 50 plus malts (Ardbegs, Balvenies, Dalmores, Caol Ilas, Bowmores, Highland Parks included) later that I truly appreciated its unique quality. At least all this disagreement keeps the distillers on their toes.","I'm no expert and only just got into whiskey, but it's worth noting that Jim Murray's whisky bible 2010 rates this 95 out of 100 so I guess he would disagree with almost everyone here?","What a dissapointment this one was! Mr Saxon needs to leave the dictionary and sample some good malts.","I did not like this one at all far to sweet! Not good at all.","This really ia a good whisky spoilt by too much sherry. I'm afraid H. Dross needs to taste a few other products.","I agree with trebor the sherry is overpowering. Surely you should be able to sample the signature of the distillery and not just the wood?

I must admit that it took me a little while to get acquainted with this malt but with the effort I grew to absolutely adore it.

Absolutly disgusting!\nIt is a shame because I love peaty whisky, I have about 20 different Islay single Malt on my shelf and none of them are so bad.\n","\nPersonal taste really matters with this one, but you should never depreciate it just because you're not used to scotch from this region. It's sweeter and more mild than the standard 16yo (compare Laphroiag's main market offering to Laphroiag Select Cask, but not quite as sweet and blunt).\nExtremely approachable even for newcomers to Islay Scotch, there's a gentleness and fresh herbal taste reminiscent of Japanese styles. Finishes long with a smoky but still very clean mint influence, a lot of herbal and fruity flavors for an Islay. This might be the best dram I've ever tasted, let alone secured its place among the best whisky I've ever tried.\nDangerously good and infuriating rare, I can't think of anything I've ever had that is measurably better. Give this a try.\n","\nPerfect balance!\n","\nI never liked Lagavulin as much as it\u2019s two neighbors on the south shore of Islay, with Ardbeg 10 being my favorite. For that reason, I never gave this stuff a second thought when it was first released at almost $100 a bottle. Now that this is an official Lagavulin bottling , and no longer a limited edition, it goes for $48 where I live. I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. I\u2019m happy I did. If you love Islay whisky, or good whisky in general you should too. While it is unmistakably Lagavulin, it has elements of both Ardbeg 10 and Laphroaig 10.

Found this 8 year old at Trader Joes for about $55 including our taxes.\nI don't know. I like the look of this pale whiskey neat, but it's a bit hot at 48%. A bit of water gives it a cloudy unappealing look, but rounds out the flavors a bit. I think for the price I'd rather have Laphroaig, (my personal fav) and for a bit more I'll buy some Bowmore 12 if I'm in the mood for pepper above the brine of Laphroaig. Not sure I'll buy another bottle.\n","\nAs much as the glut of \"special edition\" scotches on the market seems to be hitting saturation, there are really good ones you can pick out of the fray of NAS bottles. This special edition at least has a relatively \"youthful\" age statement, and since Lagavulin is practically peerless, this scotch is not going to disappoint the typical Islay enthusiast. Peaty like the 16 year with less leather character, with more salty brininess up front. Delicious scotch and a worthy inclusion to a collection.\n","\nLagavulin is an absolute favourite of mine in terms of the distillery. The 16 deserves to sit on every shelf, worktop and\/or desk of whisky lovers around the world. The distillers edition is incredible given the quality of the 16yr old. The 8yr old in my opinion is a disaster.....I find it almost undrinkable and a kin to an insufferable cousin to one of your best mates. You know they are related but apart from DNA you can find no other feature that makes them comparable. So disappointing and reserved for the wife's uncle who loves any old whisky (given the amounts he can drink)!! I may have a bad bottle but I doubt it...\n","\nThe depth of my tasting can hardly be compared to that of the producers tasting notes. I simply can not go that quite deep. I am a big fan of the 16 y.o and i must agree that the drip of water simply folds out the complexity of the fruity character hidden in the background. When the smoke and pepper have settled, you almost can touch the fruity essence. A couple of extra bottles can by all means be stored for the future if you have some spare room in your cellar.\n","\nI prefer it to the 16yr Lagavulin! It's rich and peated to the right amount, but still preserves some freshness that the 16yr does not. I will certainly buy more of this one.\n","\nVERY GOOD Islay whisky.

Although, because of Ardbeg's policy of limited release, it is getting harder to come by. WHY is this not a permanent addition to the Ardbeg range ? Gripe over. 15 years ago, I wouldn't have thanked you for any Islay whisky. I couldn't see past Speysdes such as Glenlivet or Balvennie but my taste has changed (matured?) after spending the last three summers on the Island. Quite simply, this is an exceptional  whisky.  I won't bore you with what ( I believe ) it smells and tastes like. I will only reiterate its excellence - neck and neck with Lagavulin\"s finest. p.s. Ferry already booked for this year.","Decisions...decisions...this, or Corryvreckan as the best malt in the world? Certainly the best in Islay, so what to do? Get both of course. Where the Corryvreckan is a bare knuckle fight with your tongue, Oogie dances around your senses like Ali at his best. The sherry finish adds an apparent sweetness that draws you in, and pow! smack in the face with that towering peat. Never mind christmas cake, this is like eating the xmas pud whilst it's still alight! Fantastic.","Great whisky. Great mouth feel. Great smoke. Flavors also of honey, dried cherries and almonds, raisins. 4 stars only because this is my first foray into Islay. Other targets are Bunnahabhain, Lagavulin and of course Laphroig. So will wait to add star 5.","Absolutely stunning. A sumptuous dram that gets better with a splash of water. Far exceeds my expectations.","This is simply an amazing whisky. It\u2019s right on par, or dare I say it exceeds, Lagavulin Distillers Edition. I think it does. For a whisky bottled above 50% ABV, it\u2019s incredibly friendly and easy to drink. But the tiniest splash of water really brings out more fruitiness. Wonderful stuff!","I can say this is probably my favorite whiskey.\nWhat I get from the nose is a sweet oil and smoke and after I read from the tasting notes a bit of leather.\nThe taste is excellent. Rich and bacon\/barbecue would be the best way to describe it.\nThe finish is equally sweet and thanks to the high alcohol very warming (of course, but still worth mentionin). I didn't buy this in Finland but even for the finnish price of nearly 100\u20ac this is a good buy.","Perhaps the smoothest single malt I have ever tasted.","Am-az-ing!","Magnificent. The Holy Grail of single malt.","Bought this for my husband who wanted Ardbeg for ages.  He loves Lagavulin 16yo and from reading comments from others, I chose this one.  He was over the moon with it and loves the deep peat flavour.","The best whisky I ever taste !!","The best 'smoky', better than Lagavulin 16","Sick... this is peated king. Perfect drink for real man.

I'll stick with Lagavulin.","My new favourite","Flavor explosion","Excellent whisky. Perfect in every respect -- lovely amber colour, great depth and taste.","Oh my word, this is a special whisky. The tasting notes above pretty much cover the specifics, but what impresses me the most is the sheer depth and complexity of each flavour, and the gradual order at which they come to you. Sitting with a glass of this is akin to reading a good book with your tongue; don't bother having any distractions other than perhaps a log fire or a nice view. The only whisky I've had which has surpassed this clocked in at four times the price. Sublime.","I enjoy Lagavulin 16 year, various Laphroaig and On occasion an Aberlour Malt  This is the finest Scotch Whiskey for my palate Peaty. Smoky, a bit sweet...and smooth at near cask strength.  I always drink this neat andthis is nectar of the peat bog gods .","Once I opened it, I could scent the smell of the London tube. So strong, so long. It needs to be nursed just a bit a time; it's a punch , but doesn't burn, and lasts so long. So easy to drink, so rewarding even in small amounts. Superb whisky. Great , great value for money","Best expression in the Ardbeg family...one of the best peaty whisky moments you can experience","Without a doubt, this is the best Islay whiskey ever made!","Sweet yet smokey with a marvelous  earthy finish.  Set up another and cheers!!","Bubbles when shaken are large and long lasting, indicative of the high ABV.\nCoatline was thin and legs ran thin and fast, indicating a young whisky. \nAppearance is light gold.\nNose initially peaty and then honey and fruitcake almost Xmas cake. Didn't get any salt. Fruitcake becomes more apparent further down the glass.\nPalate was strongly peaty, but then fruity.\nFinish is very long and peaty with the fruitcake certainly present..\nAmerican oak, Jack Daniels ex bourbon, is the primary cask, but the assertiveness of European sherry casking( Olorosso?) comes through in the fruitiness.\nConclusion - a lovely dessert type whisky. IMO the Ardbeg 10 year old is the peated to taste whisky to beat. UIGEADAIL is a nice occasional alternative, but certainly not a substitute for the ten.","Wonderful, the first time I had it I was indifferent. Now I can't believe how great it us","An insane whisky. I am a lover of smoky whisky and thought Laphroaig Qtr Cask was good until I tried this! Seriously recommend it to any smoky whisky drinker","My favourite affordable Ardbeg. Deep and complex, smoky with the right amount of peat. Sweet notes are bitter enough to be extremely enjoyable (I'm not a fan of 'in your face' fruitiness). Typical for Ardbeg salt, iodine and burnt tyre notes are not dominant but compliment each other perfectly. I've long stopped counting all the bottles I've bought...","A glorious whisky which fully deserves 5 stars. Huge flavours but beautifully rounded. Absolutly fantastic. In my opinion Ardbeg 10 is perhaps a purer expression of what the distillery is all about and has a little more potency in the finish, but this is still a sensational dram which belongs in any serious collection.","An absolute blinder from Ardbeg, tried this in Edinburgh. Agree totally with producers tasting notes but, I found adding water removed a lot of the flavour, this is one to add to my cabinet for sure","Love it.  After  a visit to Scottland with  whisky tasting this really is my favourite.","10 out of 10. A favourite whisky. I love its dirty salty sweetness.","A very complex Islay offering that fills the nose and challenges the palate. Well done Ardbeg!","Excellent scotch.  Very well balanced and amazingly smooth for such a high alcohol content product.","I''ve tried many whisky like Lagavulin, Laphroaig, Bowmore, Benriach, Talisker. This one is just perfect. You must try it.","This is my favourite whisky ever tried it in Edinburgh and then I bought a bottle from the whisky exchange 5 stars","I have tried Lagavulin and laphroaig they were a stronger smokey taste, however this Ardbeg nectar is to me the best dram i have ever tried to date its opened up with a little cold water to give the most amasing taste.","My favourite Islay whisky so far. Similar in smokiness to the ardbeg 10, but slightly sweeter and more complex. Fantastic whisky!","I'm a big fan of Lagavulin and Bruichladdich Port Charlotte, but I guess I just have a differing palatte from everyone else. I was not a fan of this, and I usually like peaty whiskeys. I haven't tried the Corryvracken yet, but Uigeadail just didn't float my boat.","Can still taste this whisky the day after,powerfull,sweet,smokey,smells like hotdog sausages when the glass is empty,very good dram peat fans will love this","I honestly think this is the best whisky I have ever tasted. It needs a little bit of water to open it up and reduce the dominant alcohol impact. With water the sweetness hits first, then smoke and peat with a malty and fruity taste charging through, It is robust, it is smokey and heavily peated and it is fantastic. Best ever.......get some (-:","As an Islay enthusiast I was expecting a lot and I got a lot more than I wanted. Very spirituous and rather harsh on the nose. Cannot say that I like it all frankly.","This is the whisky for me smooth and what can you say it's like velvet one of my favorite whisky's also like the talisker 18 year old.","This is just shaming everything else on my shelf right now.  Sweet, smokey with an incredible finish.  I taste something new in there every time.","Just had a bottle delivered, which i sampled straight away.\nWowww,,,sweet, smokey, smooth & very easy going.\nYou don't get much better than this.","Had this yesterday for the first time.  Like a journey that I never wanted to end...","Ardbeg Uigeadail is the finest whisky I have ever tasted !--Absolutely wonderful!","I like Batch 5, 6 & 8. As Batch 8 reveals more sherry note, very farmyard like, smoked ham and nicely peatiness. Touch of saltiness. Gorgeous cask strength by Ardbeg!","Loved the Ardbeg 10yr so I thought I would treat myself to the Uigeadail, Corryvreckan and Galileo. So glad I did! This is an immense whisky and packs a serious punch. If you like the heavily peated Southern Islay style you need to try this. For what you get it's also cracking value.","Batch L8 really top notch sherry style. One of the most heavy sherry one if compare to the rest release. Great value from Ardbeg!","Subtle cozy leather chair meet BBQ pit in my mouth. Yum!","Super sweet, medium peat and smoke....one of my favourite flavour combinations in a whisky. Lovely","I was a massive fan of Laphroaig 18yo and tried this at the suggestion of my brother in law, this destroys the Laphroaig 18yo (which I still love).  One word - amazing.  If you have 50 quid to buy one bottle of whisky, look no further, this is it.","Ardbeg, I don't know how you can sustain such a quality spirit without compromising the nose, taste, and finish.  This truly amazes me.  Superb whisky.","Perfume espetacular. Sabor inicial deixa uma oleosidade aveludada mantendo sabor prolongado, mas o final \u00e9 meio enjoativo.","Wow.  Nose - refreshing.

Taste is slightly creamy and initially very peppery like the 10 but with an extra sweetness coming in to add balance mmm. Finish is long but marred by quite distinct bitterness that comes in towards the end. Adding water brings sweetness and smoke more forward but at the expense of the pepper. Does not reduce the bitter edge in the finish.","This is, for me, ABSOLUT the best whisky !","Very balance smoky nose, very complex fragrant taste n a very deep punch in the chest. One of the best.","Amazing stuff. For me, second only th Bruichladdich Black Art","this one better than the pricy supernova...if you look @ the price this one seems ok...but if you consider the palate,finish","Outstanding stuff!!  Perfect balance of sweetness and smoke.  Get it before its gone, stock of this quality will only diminish over time.

Deep luxurious smokey tarry undertones overlayed with sweet rich flavours of dried fruit, sherry, candied cherries, mincemeat and Christmas cake. Powerful and full with a very long lingering finish.

Really nice and balance nose as well. The best Ardbeg i have already taste.","This is a very fine whisky. My wife just gave me it as a Christmas present and first impressions when opened was it was strong. I poured over an ice cube and left it for ten minutes, result was devine.

Didn't need to add water though a few drops worked ok","I'm a newbie, but for me, this is barbecue in a glass. From nose to finish. And a very great one!Absolutely amazing! The best malt I had so far. I think even a beginner should at least give it a go if he\/her can.","Magnificent!  Take the 10yo, add more salt, sherry's nutty influence, chocolate butter cake, smoked salmon, honeyed BBQ meat, moldy tree bark, green apple(?).  Some say it's less peaty but it's not, it has so much other flavor that the peat take a backseat.  Worth every cent.  500 char is not enough to describe this!","First, I hesitated to buy this malt, because of 54 -% alcohol. My worries were unnecessary. Uigeadail is perfect balance between traditional Arbeg peatyness, sweet malt and strong alcohol volume. This is not so smoky and peaty than 10y. Reminds me Lagavulin 16y, but this is more ambitious malt.","Just tried this in comparison to the 17, close call, but 17 edges it, as this is just a little too raw, must break the habit of a lifetime and add water","i agree with benkoczki so powerfull salty peat bomb.much smoother with some water added.love it","Ardbeg Uigeadail","This is my favourite Ardbeg, next to the 10 years old.

My NO.1 always now. I have many favourites, but none can touch this one. :-)","Glorious","The contrast between marine notes, peat and plum pudding was really enjoyable. A treat for lovers of peat with a blanket of cask acquired fruitiness. An altogether amazing hybrid.","Well, you can?t go wrong with an Islay malt. Perfect smokiness, oily texture, hint of toffee and saltiness. Fantastic malt, well it is Bowmore","The perfect Malt in my opinion. The smokeyness of a good Islay Malt, combined with the sweetness from the Sherry cask. Perhaps not to everyone's liking but is exactly what I look for in a good Malt.","One of the best Islay Malts","Delicious, uncomplicated, dark and smokey. As one of my close friends said, \"It's like drinking a lounge.\"","i tried it at the whisky lounge fest in york 26th october.\nnever liked Bowmore until now. WOW! really smooth and silky, exactly as Dom stated the peat does peep out from behind the sherry.\nmust have been good, they were sold our when i tried to buy a bottle there and then.","Very smooth,like silk.taste of wood and chocolate first,Smokey raisins.after taste very good,clean, little dry,still working on it.","\"Nose\": Coal, lit barbecue briquettes, smoking North Atlantic seaside bonfire.  \"Palate\": Smooth.  Combination of Islay peat and sherry flavors.  Think a sea surge of peat\/smoke meeting crates of chocolate and raisins from a lorry that rolled over into the bay.    Lilacs. \"Finish\": Lime slices in ice water with medicinal notes, sea salt and how can it be?  Ginger.","Nose is sherry sweet, fruity with hints of coffee and honey but only the faintest hint of peat. Compared to the Lagavulin distillers this is sweeter and not so peppery. It has a speysider taste about it too unlike other Islays I've tried. The finish is long and rewarding with only a small amount of bitterness creeping in at the end and maybe just a hint of peat. This is quite a good malt and my only gripe is the artificial colour but even the Lagavulins have it added.","I bought two bottles of Bowmore 15 yr old Darkest on a recent trip to Inveraray Castle.  I tried a number of 10 yr, 12 yr and 15 yr samples and this by far was the best.  Less of a peaty taste and really does warm the heart and every organ in the body with it's 46% alcohol  This is a beautiful and underestimated 15 yr old Single Malt.If you want a good tasting, strong Single Malt Whisky, then make sure you try this!","2 Favourite whiskies are Mortlach 16 and Laphroaig 18.  This one has qualities of both.  The transition between sweet then smoky is fantastic.  Beautiful coulour and \"anonymous 3rd May\" I reckon the oily texture is part of the experience, creating a long dry smoky finish.","Weirdly aligned and unbalanced.  Strong nose, indelicate smoke and cask and the in the mouth sweet like sucking on a carmel candy.  Whilst the contrast between what the nose promises and the mouth flavour delivers is stark, it is not entirely unpleasant.  Agree with Dom concerning the finish but found the texture to feel...oily. Not my first choice.","Peter,I would love to see this one in 46 -% or more. It can be matter of heaven or hell. The higher alcohol volume between 46 - 56, gives more often the real character to malt and undermine the sweetness. Anyway, thanks for comment.","this one is ... strange. There is too much going on in the nose and glass. Smokey, peaty sweet velvety - it's like at least 2 different malts mixed in one.  Not bad but will not buy again","I love this whisky; not too sweet for me with enough smoke. My second bottle had some more peat\/smoke and less sweetness so I liked it even better than the 1st time around. I do prefer this way above the 12 and also way above the Ardbeg Uigeadail ( sweeter with too grassy peat for me ; I do love however the Corryvreckan a lot! ) What I would like however they released a version at a strenght of 46 or even 48%","This a good malt, but it can't compete with any Ardbeg, Lagavulin and Laphroaig. This is simple too sweet, not very balanced. It should be much more dryer and a bit more smokier. Bowmore 12y is much better to my taste.","The 15 is much better than the 12, which I did not like. However there seems to be a hole in the flavor profile, like something is missing. I found that when I mixed it with Clynlesh 14, it made both of the 2 whiskys better. Seriously try it, you get the best of both whisky's without losing anything.","the write-up by the whisky exchange somewhat understates this beauty! Smooth and velvety - maybe like a merlot - the smoke  peeps out from behind the delicate sherry, the finish is warm and long lasting. I am yet to taste a finer drink.","very tasty,but overpriced"],"395":["\nGreat this, great value, great flavour... the 105 is a well balanced whisky with great notes of old style oloroso sherry, stewed autumn fruit, and the dry \/sweet slightly hard edged Glenfarclas signature note.. at 60% and at this price it's a favourite of mine as a stock whisky... It always hints of the use of great quality casks and is always consistently good.\n","\nThis is one of the best\/strongest whiskys I have had. I found by just adding a tiny bit of water to the whisky it took the edge off it, making it so smooth.\n","\nvery nice, smooth and big taste ;-)\n","\nI have had a few bottles of this in the past, after having first sampled it at the distillery. If you're into BIG sherry whiskies, then this, along with A'Bunadh and Glendronach, is for you. It can be taken neat (even at 60%) or can take quite a dash of water, if that's your preference. It's full of flavour whatever you choose. And, with this deal, you can't go wrong!\n","\nIf you like your sherry casks with a nice kick to them, this is a great option. Definitely a big hitter not lacking in punch, but it still goes down nice and smoothly.\n"],"396":["\nI was blown away by this scotch. Smooth, smoky and perfectly balanced.\n","\nOne of my all time favorite tipples, love the smoky peatiness of it.\n","\nOutstanding whisky, but maybe not for casual scotch drinkers.\n","\nGreat whiskey!\n","\nWowzers! My new favourite by far: fire and brimstone, a pyromaniacs dream... I'd give it 6* - off the scale!!\n","\nDefinitely worth the price. Perfect smoky and a good taste of tobacco but a little bit too dry for my taste. It gets better and better the more you drink.\n","\nSmooth with the right amount of peat for us Islay fanatics. Complex and finishes with a touch of sweetness . Great bottle.\n","\nI\u2019m completely smitten by this Islay that has so much character. I have multiple bottles of famous scotches which come in fancy bottles and gold crested labels and other embellishments, that are simply ignored. I find myself reaching for the unpretentious bottle every time I open the drinks cabinet. Lovely.\n","\nIt's absolutely unique. I love it. You can feel the rough scottish climate cold and windy. Wind, sea waves, rocks and fireplaces smoke. Best single malt I've ever drank. Correction: the best period.\n","\nSimply the Best.\n","\nThis is only the 3rd single malt added to my new founded collection. It is also my 1st Islay. I chose this one based on the amount of good reviews it has. Nose - smoke, iodine, brine, seaweed, rope, spices. Palate - Smoke, brine, kippers, a very mild spice. Finish - dry, but soft and sweet, followed by an increase in smoke, aswell as the sense of a very salty, smoked meat, with a long finish. Upon smelling this, I was abit wary of my 1st taste of this, and imagined myself choking up, but it is pleasantly smooth, and really is moreish. I'd recommend to anyone looking to try their first Islay. This will be a continually stocked bottle I think. Imagine a drop of water would open it up abit more but im yet to try, as my 1st dram was so complex and quite truthfully beautiful. I think it is an aquired taste though, and you either love it or hate it, but after my 1st sip, I feel like spreading this gem around hither and yon, but Ill be keeping it mostly to myself I think.\n","\nDoes not get much better than this, superb.\n","\nit is wonderful. can smell the sea salted bogs which makes it unmatchable, in its own class. once you have some you get hooked for that aromatic sensation of the ocean and the bogs. entirely its own animal and should be given a latin species name!\n","\nMy favourite whisky.

Intense smoke and peat, which leaps out as expected, very heavy to the nose, but has other flavors that quickly emerge, including tobacco & some sweeter fruits. It isn't a sweet whisky at all, though, and requires a certain palate. Recommend trying a dram at the pub with a meal, neat or with a splash of water to open up those sweeter notes. This was the single malt that convinced me to really get into whisky.","Not as heavily smoky as I thought it would be. Definitely getting citrus coming through and my goodness kippers. I'm on my first bottle and it won't be my last. Heaven in a glass.","It's amazing, the people who rate this less then 5 stars don't drink whisky. They drink Budweiser and think it's great. This is for a more refined taste.","If I had to recommend just one Islay single malt to someone who had never tasted them, this would be it.  It's exceptional.","This whisky is my personal benchmark. If anything I try is better than this, well, that means this particular whisky is on the top. There is a few actually, but not that many. Back to this Laga 16yo, a very smoky whisky, coastal and salty fish notes with some fresh fruits like lemon and lime, intense and perfectly balanced. What else? Maybe not for people that like these \"sherry\", \"taste like porto\" whiskies...","As the first swish thickens on your palate, you're instantly transported to a time and space where cold sea foam meets briny bracing salt air.  The second swish introduces a lift of light smoke that lands you into a lingering warmth of subtle citrus wrapped in a hint of pine sap.  a truly outer body experience.  Not a journey for the novice, but one well respected once the mind (and palate) is opened to it.","The best bang for your dollar, hands down!","I purchased this product for a friends 70th birthday, the process was quick and easy, delivery was exactly on time, well packaged. I am sure being a whisky lover he will be more than happy.","After years of tasting it was love at first taste","Personal all time favorite and probably the best single malt available in Finland. Not for people who want an easy flavor, but it does ease in after the first sip.","I bought this as a present as I know the recipient likes this. However, I do not like it, as it is too smoky and too peaty for my taste.","Had a glass at a restaurant. I found the smoke flavor overpowering, so much so that I had to keep the glass away from me between sips. Adding some water made it drinkable, but it still tasted like a campfire mixed with paint thinner.","Not an expert but one of the most exceptional Scotch whiskies I have had the chance to taste. Smoky at first and an incredible finish, almost like a delicious cake although difficult to describe.","Absolutely beautiful. On first taste it is very smoky, but after the second sip it mellows \u2013 very creamy on the after taste. If in doubt, buy the 20cl and it will change your life.","Lagavulin 16. \r\n\r\nYou are reading this wondering, 'is this worth the price?' And the answer is YES. \r\n\r\nPerhaps the finest whisky available (yes it has been dyed but so has the hair of your favourite starlet). Even if it is your last money in the world, spend it on this. You will be a well respected and a learned hobo while sipping on this absolutely world-class single malt. People will think you are being ironic whilst sleeping on the streets. It buys class. \r\n\r\nJesting aside, it really is a great bottle. I remember myself at 16 years old - hypnotic, unhinged, perfect alcohol content and an expert at leaving a taste that kept them coming back for more. Lagavulin is a lot like this. Buy a bottle. Now.","The best Scotch I have ever consumed, period.","My all-time favourite.","This scotch gets better and better as you go. It's easily one of my favorites. A bit pricey, but completely worth it.","Distinctive, smokey, dry, lingering taste... Not an immediate winner but a taste that you're drawn back to.","Amazing, my \u201cgo-to\u201d scotch. First tasting was all it took to become my favorite.","I love it","Very smoky peat taste... bold but smooth.","One of the best Islay single malts. Lagavulin 16 tastes like smoking a pipe on a fishing barge by yourself, with nary a coast in sight, or sitting by a crackling log fire by the forest late at night. Smooth and sea-salty without distracting sweetness like some of the other single malts. If you are one of those who is able to its appreciate unique character, you will never go back to anything else.","An absolutely stunning dram. I guess you really do get what you pay for! I bought this having previously tried Laphroaig 10, and I'm blown away by the extra complexities in the flavours. Not one to be rushed, and I find a little water helps to open the flavours up a bit.","Just try it and you\u2019ll be hooked if you like sweet peaty flavors in scotch. Outstanding.","I liked Laphroaig 10 and a colleague recommended Lagavulin. The first time I had this, I was sold. My favourite. Smoky and smooth with a distinct aftertaste.","Lagavulin 16 got me into whisky. My first time drinking this dram was truly a phenomenal experience. There is something really special about the smouldering warmth that follows the signature smoky, peaty nose and palate. Love it or hate it, Lagavulin 16 still stands as one of the best single malts on the market, with lots of value-for-money as well.","I appreciate all the regions and their expressions  but no other whisky comes close for me. Sitting in front of the fire with my dog after a day in Scottish mountains, 2 glasses in to a Laga 16. Can't get much better. Ignore the low star reviews because too smoky or peaty for certain palates. You can't  criticise an Islay for having the characteristics of an Islay in the same way you can't criticise a cat for not being a dog (as it were). If you appreciate Islay whisky, know what you are buying and have half an idea what they're about and what to expect, then you can do no wrong here... beats excellent Ardbeg  and Laphroaig equivalents....King to the Islay princes.","This is a benchmark of Islay Whisky. Yes it has has colouring and produced for masses but nevertheless a very enjoyable experience.","Stunning Whiskey. Deep and complex but simply divine. By far the best peated whiskey around and now my go to drink. Highly recommended.","This  is  a  very  disappointing  purchase. Paint  thinner  has  about  the  same  taste,  unless  I  got a  bad  bottle. If this  is  how  it  should  taste you  would  be  a  fool to  buy  it.","Smokey notes beautifully combined with fruity sweet finish. Sweet peat monster. Loved it. Got it from the whiskey exchange Edinburgh","I first was introduced to  Lagavulin at a wine store. A person had come in to buy some wine and was referred to me for recommendations. After helping him he went over and got a bottle of Lagavulin. He asked me if I had tried this and I told him I had only had blended scotches. (This was 40 years ago). I asked him what single malt I should try. I'll never forget his reply.\"There's many a fine single malt laddie,but the only one I would go to war over is Lagavulin\". I've drank many a fine single malt, but I have to agree with him.","I had it 2 times after dinner on my Scotland holiday and loved it !","You really can't call yourself a fan of whisky until you try Lagavulin 16. Islay scotches are well-known for their bombastic approach to strong peaty smoke, which tends to garner them a love it-or-hate it following, but Lagavulin transcends those debates altogether. It's simply one of the most excellent scotch whiskies ever. No other dram has quite the balance of peaty aroma and delightfully sweet-n-savory drinkability found here. The campfire smoke combines brilliantly with remarkably smooth fruity flavors and hints of brininess. Goes great with a rib steak or other hearty dishes. Truly one of, if not the best, and definitely in our top three along with Oban 14 and Talisker 10.","Its simply amazing. If you like peat, you cant go wrong with this. Keeps you coming back for more.","My childhood of crashing seas and heavy skies revisited. Seaweed and peat overtones. Warming but not overpowering. Move over Laphroaig 10, there's a new player in town.","Sorry to say that this is the absolute worst Single Malt I have tried- so far. Smells of gasoline exhaust and the taste was very bitter. Have gone back to Macallan 10 year old.","I have tired many good whiskies, but this was something special.  The aroma is absolutely best in my mouth, even my wife who don't like the taste of whisky in common, fell in love with Lagavulin 16 year old. I have tried to find something  I could like as much, tasting many excellent single malts, but not succeeded.","My first initial smell had me thinking of floor laquer... BUT it gets better as you drink.\n \nAberlour 18 is much better.","My all-time favourite.","This is my favorite spirit.  I love the rich taste and smokiness.  I like Laphroaig 10 but feel that it's not as rich as this.  When I swallow this a taste something like chocolate come up in the back of my mouth.","I am pretty sure it does not rain in heaven. But if it does, it\u2019s raining Lagavulin.","Exceptional.  It's possible the 92 point review is even a touch low.","Quite simply the best whiskey I have ever tried. Every sip takes you on a different journey.","This is a great scotch (I also have the 1999 Distiller's Edition but prefer this one), but requires a bit of preparation, I think, to get the most out of it. For example, by pouring it into a small Glencairn glass you will get an alcohol bomb followed by peat (nice peat), but using a glass that is a bit wider, I think you get better aromas.\n\nAfter a few sips, I always add two drops of water to open it up.  As other reviewers note, it is a harmony of peat, brine, and a certain smooth, sweet, mildly fruity taste. I love drinking this slowly with no disturbances. This is a real pleasure to drink.","The trick is to add just enough water. Too much will loose its taste too little will keep the peaty scent too striking.","As Brian Cox put it Lagavulin is indeed the cognac of scotch whisky.\n\nThe smoke is so well-balanced with the rest of the spirit and that kippers taste will keep you coming back for more.\n\nI would advise that you don't add any water or ice. Savour it as you find it. Delectable stuff. 6 out of 5","Excelent!!!","very very pungent. All I could smell and taste was smokey iodine and kelp.","I don\u2019t drink whiskey, well I thought I didn\u2019t like it until I tried this very good smokey whiskey. I will give it a try soon","I sampled a bottle of this at Christmas, superb. A friend had just been on whisky tasting course so he brought his expertise to the table. The first sip was like fire water, then the smokiness came through, the 2nd was salty, literally like tasting the sea. The third was a sublime sweetness. The complex flavours continually open up & the whisky seemed to get better & better with every dram. The bottle lasted 4 weeks & has ruined me, nothing I've tried since has come close. Be warned, you won't go back to anything else once you've tried this. Not cheap, but incredible value for such a quality malt.","My favorite alcohol of all time. Smooth, smokey and complex. Elevates any event, and leaves you wanting more.","Smokey, smooth, and very aromatic. Be warned,  This is not something I\u2019d recommend for a first timer.","Wonderful smokey smooth single malt that delights. Tried first on Burns night!","I LOVE peaty whiskies, but Oh my god it\u2019s too intense! I love Lagavulin 12, but the 16 YO is too much for my taste!\nI have around $20,000 worth of whiskies in my collection and I love every single bottle that I have. But I honestly don\u2019t know what to do with this one. Too much! The smoke is not even peaty, it\u2019s just like you put your noise and mouth on the exhaust of an old car that is having an engine start failure! Have tried this bottle 3 times so far hoping that I change mind, but it gets worse every time! Just awful!","Enjoying my very first glass of Lagavulin 16...all the smokiness and peat, with hints of the ocean (kelp!?)...I really like how it leaves my palate after each sip...brilliant!","Acquired taste this one,but if you like it..you love it!!!!Amazing flavours...great fun to sip and savour and wallow in those Lagavulin tastes!","Love it. Agree with Brian Cox - cognac of the whiskies","Full of wonderful campfire smokiness. a drinking experience that can only be compared to a brisk walk on a wild Scottish headland","One of my favourite malts, Love the nose and the lasting flavour is great with a powerful smoke coming through. Brilliant and Christmas time when I get a new bottle always makes me happy. A must buy for a smoke fan","It seems to be a love or hate Scotch. The complexity to me means my palate won\u2019t hit on only one or two aspects. Every sip is slightly different. Never boring! My birthday celebration whisky!","Such a great Islay whisky, really changes from peated smoke to sweet with a little water and half hour in the glass. So complex and an amazing finish. Just a few glasses into my first bottle of this one but will have to keep it in my rotation for sure. Just an excellent Islay whisky.","Most pungent Islay of all single malt","Lapsang Souchong on crack.","Wow what a peated smoke hit. It's quite strong and perhaps not everyones cup of tea. It goes great with smoked salmon and blue cheese.  If your not sure whether you will like it, why not try the selection box with it in. I will buy this again .","Peat and smoke reviews are upfront and accurate. That being said, keep it out of your hand when drinking, the warmth created drastically changes the initial notes. Keep it cool for first sips washed with sour apple while second and third give way to almond butter and burnt plum. Tops.","Strong peat start but has a great smooth finish. Have to give it a couple sips and\/or a few minutes but it is an excellent Isley whiskey","First time a tasted this brand.\nIt's very smokie with long after taste.","Complex and very smooth, a must for every whiskey enthusiast.","This is complex and unique like all great whiskies.  I wish I could give it 4.5 stars.  Laguvulin\u2019s neighbor to east, on the south coast of Islay, is Ardbeg.  Ardbeg 10 is my favorite Islay whisky and one of my favorites in general.  It\u2019s neighbor to the east is Laphroaig.  I also like Laphroaig 10 better than this.  Both cost a lot less money.  Personally,  I find this to be more comparable to Caol Ila 12,  located on the east coast of Islay.  However, if you love the style, you owe to yourself to give this a try.  I\u2019m sure that some of you will agree with me and some of you will like this one the most.","Not as it was.. A bit deminished. Something amiss with those casks?\n\nIt would have been 4 stars if Lagavulin wasn't artificially  coloured  or chill-filtered.. Please Stop It Deagio.","Wonderful slightly peaty and really hits the spot.","One of the best Islay whiskys I have ever had along with Talisker 18. So sophisticated and smooth, yet so fiercely smoky and peated.","Worst whiskey ever, way too smokey, horrible smell and after taste","Truly the water of life!","My first foray into smoke having previously called Oban 14 my favourite whisky. Instantly loved it. Despite it's power I find it extremely smooth and very drinkable. I've done a bit of a tour since my last bottle but none have come close. Now I want smoke again and really should try Bunnahabin 12..but maybe later :)","It's unlike anything else. The oily texture, the perfect peatiness and the brine are as if they are bound by nature. Beautiful.","Took some getting used to, but my god what a stunner.","This is the first scotch that I truly loved!","One of my all time favourite whiskys. Great stuff","Recently bought this whisky for a friend as a present. Tasting it together, we found it reminiscent of a campfire by the sea. Smoky, sweet, a hint of salt towards the end. Oily and full throughout. It had heat to it, but it was never too much. A well bought gift for the price.","kissed by heaven while smoked next to a roaring wood, peat fire.","Great flavour.  Not for the faint of heart though.  Have a sip.  Then another.  It gets better each time it passes your lips. Nice way to end a great day.","Great stuff!","Surprisingly fruity for such a peaty Whisky. Not a huge fan of all Islay Whiskies, but this one has a place and time to shine. I found it goes very well with a seafood dish or post meal dram when a big punch of flavour is in need. 3.5 Stars from me.","Always the best. It's never lacking.","One of my favourite single malts, i love the burnt wood undertone. Its a good winter warmer.","This is the best whisky I have ever tasted absolutely beautiful!","Five stars. My personal favorite. Forget the tasting notes and allow it to speak for itself.","I can't drink this whisky without smiling","One of the best peated scotch I've ever had.","Lovely!! 5\/5 10\/10 100\/100. And so on","One of the finest whiskies I have tasted. Its smooth and very complex aroma (Creamy vanilla, spicy and somewhat a hint of iodine). Smoky and peaty taste, which has unique sweetness and is nice.","My favorite scotch of all , simply the best , so smooth and complex at the same time","Wonderful!  Far from the most expensive malt, it is a many layered, complex example of the finest Islay whiskey.  Mild peat blended with a hint of smoke, it is my favourite tipple to enjoy in quiet contemplation.  Too much?  Nah!","Received as a gift.  Recently retired FDNY put it on the shelf and waited for the right day.  16 years later... Never Forget.  Smooth and smokey the way life should be.","At the price ranges I explore, this is my #1 or #2 dram. (Talisker 10 is the other) What a fabulous drink. All that Islay peat combined with some orange and stuff from the ocean. It's an amazing Islay. I imagine myself sitting by the Atlantic on a chilly day with a fire. And drinking this fantastic stuff.","Eeeeewwwwwwww, son. This tasted like a campfire","Good but not worth the price.","Nectar of the gods.","Perhaps the smoothest most in depth characteristics of any of the whisky's iv'e tried. The smoothness is brilliant, very palatable and easy to drink. I often like to add a couple small drops of water to unlock some of the subtle flavors. Any Pub I go to if they have this whisky I'll take it over anything else on the menu. If you haven't yet tried it you're doing yourself an injustice.","This Scotch is an amazing and economical weight reduction potion.\n\nSip and ponder your way through a single straight shot, and when done enjoy how the taste changes for the next hour or more.  Because you *will* taste it for the next hour or more.\n\nYou see, you won't want to drink or eat anything else for all that time.  This one small glass will keep you occupied for hours.\n\nOf course if you don't like Islay, forget it.","Smooth.......","Superb.!! The single malt for the single malt enthusiast. An outstanding Islay. Complex and delicious to the palate","It's a lovely companion after a long day.","Mind blowing.  Forget about the price range. I have tasted whinkys much more expensive -that are not HALF as good as this. It is dry and complex and I simply can't put it down. LOVED IT","An absolute delight great aroma and a treat for the palate a fusion of tastes with a smokey peat overtone. Enjoy and savour","I'll preface this by saying my usual scotch\/whiskey\/bourbon preferences lean more towards the sweet and honey tones from brands like Suntory, from Japan.\n\nI'm not usually a \"scotch person\" because sometimes the peat overtones can be a little overbearing, and the smoke flavor can overwhelm the more nuanced touches.\n\nIn fact, I don't usually leave reviews. Ever. I just felt compelled to, because this is a brilliant single malt, with a certain brine character that mixes well with its sweetness -- like salted caramels. A slight brine can add to sweetness, and balance it, and in this bottle, it does.\n\nI can understand why some of the more hardcore scotch people are giving it three star reviews here, but if you're not looking for that \"hardcore scotch\" peat and smoke flavor, and you like it a little sweeter and saltier, you can't go wrong with this.","I feel you need a good imagination to talk sea side overtones.... what I can say is the smokey pet shines through to complement a sweet oak taste and a smooth  finish. It can be a little rough on the palette if you chew it to long, but frankly I love the sensation. A great whisky that refined pallets will enjoy","A superb Lagavulin. After at least 16 yrs in the cask, the peat has died down a bit, revealing new layers of complexity on the nose, with phenolic notes and coastal (bay) overtones and brine. The palate is full, smoky, dry, and peaty.","It's complex nose and taste make for a good dram but not great.   3.5\/5","I bought my first Lagavulin a few years ago and I was totally blown away. The smokey intensity, the taste of the seaside, that iodine, and its silky smooth texture, all married together in harmony. Then I bought a bottle fairly recently and most of those flavours were gone - no saltiness and seaside taste; the aftertaste was shorter and had less bite. Its aroma was lessened. I was quite disappointed. However, it's still a nice and complex scotch but at its current price (?53.55) I don't think it's worth it. Unfortunately, for me, it certainly has lost a lot of what used to make it great.","This is one of the greatest whisky's -  not for those who dislike a strong smokey drink.   It has an almost salty brine which gives it a powerful, unique flavor.","This is a great one, not the most peaty but the overall is very on point ! Everything fits together and have its part so you can taste a lots of things each seconds and perfectly equilibred !!! Lagavulin had worked hard on and you will absoluty taste it ! Flavorfull and the peaty not to far to remember you are still in the peat and in the sea, islay ! My favorite on the overall if you are looking for all kinds of taste at the same times ( i mean if you are looking for peat go with laphroaig ...) if you want alots and peat with it try this one!! I have to keep one in my closet for the moment i feel calm on a beautifull or even on a raining day ! This will keep you thinking and dreaming for hours !!! Taste it !!","Simply the best whiskey in its price range. Takes a lot more money to match its complexity.","Insanity in a bottle o' liquid peat.\nIt'll kick yer azz.","This is the most amazing Peat Whisky I have ever had in my life!!!!","Nothing like it in its price range. Carnival of flavour: dry apricot and smoke that lingers long after you've left the ride. Must have.","Got hooked by pure coincidence and can't think of anything else that I can call my favorite malt..","My new fave. Complex, Smokey and Smooth.  As you get through each level of flavour another kicks in, it lasts an age on the pallet.  Awesome dram at a reasonable (for the quality) price.","Fantastic smoky flavour. I love it","A warming winter whisky that makes you feel like putting on your smoking jacket and slippers and relaxing in front of an open fire .","This stuff is beyond amazing. So complex, smooth, lots of peat, and full of flavor. \n\nDifferent flavors hit every 5 seconds. Just when you think it is done it smacks you across the face!\n\nAmazing scotch!","From the sea to the smokers. Brilliant.","Outstanding.  From the first whiff you know your in for something special, and the first taste confirms.  Very satisfying, very hard to put down.","What can I say but WHAT AGREAT SCOTCH! Got it for Christmas and the best gift I have had in years. So smooth it warms the heart. I love the smoky flavour of it. Makes me feel like reaching for my pipe. I really love that hint of sweetness to it as well. Not harsh but a lovely sipping whiskey that holds you in heaven.","My first bottle, and I like it.","An exceptionally well balanced peat monster. The smokiness that the pest imparts is only part of this wonderful scotch' profile.  Incredible and very sophisticated scotch. The best Islay I have yet tasted.","Smokey but not as harsh as Ardbeg... added just a teaspoon of water or one cube might over do it...nice mixture of sweetness and peat, very easy going down!! Nice single malt !!","Great, marvelus taste","Always a winner and the best. I'll punch anybody in the mouth who says 16 has had a down turn lol","Excellent, peat and sweet in Beautiful harmony","It's the nearest thing to drinking Angels tears","reminds me of the old coal miners sweets very smokey tastes of vanilla and peat aswell dandilion and burdock almost in a way one of the best islay available one to try at least once in your life","Should be in every mans liquor cabinet...the beginning the middle and the end. at any price","Amrut (Nectar) of Life !!","Peaty and rich. Full bodied. Multilayered and pungent. \nNose is refined peat, orange, vanilla and tea.\nPalate is salty peaty smoke, chilli\nFinish long peat smoke chilli \nA fine alternative to the other KILDALTON peated whiskies. Guaiacol phenolic compounds more pronounced than the cresols, so more smokey than medicinal.\nLess peaty than Ardbeg or Laphroaig both of which are mid 20s ppm in the final spirit, this is about half that.","One of the very best value for money, easily available, not surprisingly so popular. Not for every day , always remarkable for a stunning delicious smoke that long long lasts in the nose and brain.","Nectar of the gods","Smoky but also incredibly well balanced in such a way that the peat does not overwhelm the other flavours present. A warming, and complex whisky that definitely gets my vote","Comparable to Laphraoig 10, but Lagavulin 16 lingers softly as opposed to Laphraoigs 10 extremely intense expression of 'smokeyness' & 'peat' flavours. The extra outlay is worth it, plus this has 43% abv :-)","Mothers milk","Finally I found a scotch that I love! I'm an American and a bourbon connoisseur. I love me some Basil Hayden's, Russell Reserve and other super premium\/premium bourbons. I had tried several Scotch'es but most tasted like saltwater, peat, smoke and seaweed. On about my 2nd drink all the Scotch'es I had tried gave me that nausea I get from Beam white. Maybe it's too much sugar or I have no idea. But I'm sure all you connoisseurs know what I mean. Anyway I had seen where on, Whisky find the best, this got a 98% score so I thought I'd try it. Trust me, it's outstanding and the buzz is one of the best. I highly recommend this. As long as I can afford this, it will be in my staple as well as Basil Hayden's.","The first time i tasted the Lagavulin 16 i wasnt a fan, but after gaining more experience with scotch i came back to it, more aware of the flavor profile and with a new respect for just how smooth this malt is bearing none of the burn or hard finish. Absolutely love the peat and smoke combined with the overall mellowness.","Bought a bottle for Christmas and I'm currently drinking the last dram as I type this. It's a very enjoyable whisky but it doesn't offer any surprises, which does make it a good go-to regular. Bottom line; Laphroaig 10 is superior in my opinion but don't pass up the opportunity to try this whisky.","Superior Scotch. Great sipping whisky to enjoy while reading the latest best-seller, or contemplating a beautiful sunset.","Had a bottle of this in 2013 and it was my favourite dram ever - rich, subtle, complex, lingering. 2015 and it's gone downhill badly. Really nasty chemical note swamping all before it and sending me scurrying back to refuge in Talisker. If i wanted to drink smokehead at my local spit and sawdust i could do so at a fraction of the cost. Very very disappointing.","My favourite scotch!","Very bad. I used to be a fan but this 2015 offering is a chemical disaster. \nPerhaps a doctor could use it for sterilizing wounds, Germolene does the same job.","Tried this tonight at my local pub. Very nice indeed!! Very smokey but far from in a bad way, went down a bit too easy if I say so haha! Made all the more special when I realised I was getting it at ?3 a glass! Stunning, and will definetly look to get myself more of this!","Started the year with Ardberg Ugh & 10yrs, but kept going back to Lagavulin 16, already on my 3rd bottle. Its so precious now that i have started to ration it.","Today was the first time I tried this scotch. Inhaling deeply thru the nose, I sneezed every time.  Laphroaig is my Favorite, but this is different than all others. My second Favorite for now.","A wonderful Islay single malt. Smooth and smokey with great depth.","Stunning malt favourite islay malt","Fantastic!","Excellent product. Clear alcohols are for rich women on diets.","Lagavulin 16 year old used to be great malt back in 2011. Now it''s just another dull, mediocre, overpriced Islay malt. It''s very sad!","The whisky that overcame my dislike of whisky! Up until trying a 16 year old Lagavulin in the Aultguish Inn one evening I''d never found a whisky I liked, finding them harsh and \"burning\". However, this is smooth and full of wonderful smoke and peat. I cannot describe how much I love this drink!","I have tried all the Islay''s and this one comes a very close second to Ardbeg \"Uigeadail\"","Phenomenal Single Malt! When it''s Islay, it''s peat! My personal favorite!","I got my first bottle of Lagavulin 16 now in summer 2015 and I have to say this bottle isn''t very peaty at all.","So smooth smokey taste is not overpowering . Perfect","I can''t believe I''m saying this but this fine product has changed. Ordered one while out, I hardley recognized it. One of my all time favorites, was very different. Little smoke, lack of depth, quick finish. Convinced the bar keep made a mistake, I went to the bar to see the bottle.  It was the Lagavulin 16 but seeing it almost empty, I thought that must be it.  Asked for a new bottle, which they had and gladly opened. Had another but while marginally better, same feeling of loosing an old friend for this was not what it use to be by a wide margin. I sadly went home, poured my own and the classic smokey amazing 16 was back.  I may have cherish the ones I have in case they have changed forever.","Re-Review: My older review was based on a bottle purchased in 2013 (which may have been older). I ordered another in June 2015, and feel like its missing something. With the older bottle, as soon as you opened it you could smell smoke across the room. With the new bottle I get less smoke, more bite, less complexity, less development as the whisky is drawn down in the bottle and exposed to air. Sad. Hopefully I just got a bad batch. I might try the LG3 next time instead.","It''s damn good.","Beautiful.","Amazing! I saw this one morning earlier this week, on a short program about Scotland distilleries.. As inexperienced as I am about alcohol, seeing as I just turned 21 and didn''t have much of an interest in drinking until I had some whiskey fudge last fall and I was hooked on whiskey. I thought I would try Lavagulin for my first  real taste of the liquid whiskey, and I fell in love last night with the first sip! I can''t get it off my mind it is so delicious!When I read that it had seaweed in it, I laughed. I had found my beverage! Thanks to the long history of Islay! :)","The greatest malt I''ve ever had. I assumed this was just due to inexperience, and for years tried to find better. I have been unsuccessful.  Several things to notice:\nIncredible complexity: some peated whisky is just peat, this is so much more. The most smoke I''ve ever had, but with honey and an awesome finish. Opening a bottle is quite an experience, as the smoke escapes and permeates the room.\n\nNote: I visited the distillery, and had Lagavulin from 12 - 43 years old right from the cask. The 16 year old captures the best of all.","My favourite malt by far, a simmering combination of peat, fire, and iodine.","I have become a fanatic.  Enough said.","The first time I tried this I had to take the smallest sips. Felt like I had sat around the camp fire all night when I woke up. However, could not stop thinking about the flavour after that. Craved it! It is now my favourite. I keep trying others, but not sure why. It is so much richer and complex and not too much alcohol like Ardbeg. Perfect balance!","I sip it from a brandy sniffer...it is the most superb Islay I have tasted!","The king of single malts for me. Nothing else I''ve tried even comes close. Huge pungent smoky\/peaty flavours up front, then tea (esp. lapsang souchong), salted caramel and dried fruit notes. Absolutely sublime.","First taste of Lagavulin 16yr was so smokey that I was quite surprised. However I fell in love with this special single malt immediately. Its deep, deep taste is just unbelievable. 10 out of 10, triple As.","When will somebody export lagavulin here in The Philippines? I just wanna sip this fantastic Scotch drink to my mouth. Heard that it tastes heavenly... I''m on white horse now temporarily...!","Lagavulin girl... She''s my lagavulin baby girl. Best spirit tasted yet, i''m blown away.","I would hear reviews about \"peaty\" & \"smoky\" whiskies and would be scared yet excited to know if I would like this type of whisky or not. This bottle was my introduction and I am by far pleased with the taste. It held my hand to understand completely now what reviewers are talking about when they speak about \"smoke\" and how it is such a pleasant flavor when tasting other notes in whisky. I must admit that for the quality you are getting within this price range is absolutely fantastic. I think this bottle just became a signature staple on my shelf.","Top notch all time favorite, best in price range","More than I can say.","Easily the most enjoyable single malt!","the last thing I would like to taste be fore  idie","Exceptionally rich, complex and sophisticated.  The peaty, smoky theme is ever present, but look for all the other subtle flavors of tobacco, caramel, charcoal and tea.  There is a feeling of luxurious thickness to the liquid.  The best Scotch there is when you''re in the smoky mood!","Santorini, under the moonlight, listening Santana. Simply perfect.","I love it me.","Fabulous aroma and a wonderful taste , definitely one to savour and enjoy","The first whiskey I really loved, and still do.","This is an amazing malt. I will certainly be buying more of this malt.","After trying Ardbeg 10 thought I'd found heaven in a glass - but this one has just set the cat amongst the pigeons!  Perfectly balanced with the right amount of peat and wonderfully complex finish. Needs very little water added - unlike the Ardbeg.  Can't make up my mind which one is better, maybe I'll just buy both and carry on deliberating!!","Truer words were never spoken 'Lagavulin has ruined every other whiskey for me' This whiskey makes mere mortals feel like they are enjoying life after death in paradise! An absolute bargain!","ive known this whiskey for 20 years but havent had any for years until my birthday when 2 bottles turned up one from my wife and one from my son what a islay malt this is it gives you such a wonderfull feeling i allow myself 1 dram a month with a nip of room temp water mmmmm  billy rock nook littleborough lancs","2 more bottles on the way. What more can I say, an excellent dram.","This is a wonderful whisky and one of my favorites. I keep it for winter and have just had my first one of the season. Some people never get on with peated whisky ( probably a sweet tooth) so never like it, but if you do, This could be the one for you. Very well made.","On the first sip of this enthralling dram it felt like a mermaid had lept from the shores of Islay and slapped me across the face with her soft briney hand then wispered something pleasingly debauched in my ear, as it develops on your palette your taste buds are thrown into a mesmerising labyrinth when the tobacco like peat flavours lead you to a finish that reminds me of a warm satisfying hug from my favourite social worker.","Have to agree with all the reviews, I have tasted more or less every whisky on offer at an affordable price that is to say however if I were offerd a bottle in the relm of hundreds of pounds I would be tempted to give it a go but know true to my heart it would be lagavulin I would return. Love ya lag always thanks for sharing yourself with me and I drink you with great respect all you chaps before","Best value from Lagavulin series! Top notch, best dram & well crafted!","I've had a bottle of this for a while now & have tried many different Islay whisky's (and many other non Islay too!). But the balance of smell,flavour & the ability to transport you to a completely different world hasn't been bettered by any so far. A truly magnificent dram!","I was given a bottle of 16 for Crimble and was truly blown away. Very special and what a perfect balance of everything that makes a perfect whisky! It will always have a place in my cabinet.","tasted this whisky at our friends over New year's day 2013 what a fabulous whisky full of flavours that left the most fantastic taste in the mouth , this malt is simply the best I have tried and my opinion would be very hard to beat.","I've been hooked on the stuff for 30 years since a friend gave me an almost full bottle because he didn't like it! He was,of course,stone mad.","What can you say,one of the very best malts around.\r\n12 year old limited editions are even better.","I was given a bottle for Xmas last yr, & i wouldn't mind another this year either.\nSmooth, with a distant smokey warm taste.","muy rica malta, suave pero intensa, y en el final explota con esa dulzura de frutas y cebada.","Lagavulin 16 yo is today considerably less than it used to be. Ralfy suspects that it's results of new, cheaper production process. Sad but true. Unfortunately, same thing with Talisker 10 yo.","When I first tried 15 yo Lagavulin I was blown away with its gentle power.  I don't like the strong, smokey, peaty flavour of Laphroaig but Lagavulin despite being peaty & smokey is so mature and full flavoured, perhaps as sweet as an Islay whisky can get plus its incredibly long, strong finish which makes it the best in the world for me!","Huge, full bodied, all the smoke and peat you could wish for, but polished as no other malt. Something special.","Just tried it for the first time tonight and must say it is one of the best whiskey's I have tasted I need to go buy a bottle now ! \nBeechy","Hm, what can i say. I am Irish whiskey lover, but Lagavulin is the best whisky of world. Amazing!","like smoke in a bottle","Lagavulin whisky has ruined every other whisky for me...","Have tried every Islay whiskey money can buy, this is by far THE best whisky i have enjoyed!","This is unbelievable whisky and i am compelled to share this.","Lagavulin best feeling you can have with your clothes on.","Beautiful flavor, smoky, musky, soft velvet, really  warm hug, the best scotch i had taste so far.","Lagavulin is simply the best single malt in the world, it has everything that whisky making can offer poured into every bottle.When you get that atlantic ocean taste and smell when the top comes of the first time your are hooked for life.","The taste of Scotland","if i could only ever buy one bottle of single malt again lagavulin would be it. nothing i have sampled before or since can compare to it! believe the hype.","Delicious!  I used to drink Lagavulin back in the 90s when it was properly priced.  I loved it then, but I stopped buying when the price went up to staggering levels.  Now it is back on my cabinet shelf thanks to the aggressive pricing of late and it is as great tasting as ever!!!  Oh how I missed thee, delicious and expertly peated, light delicate smoke, sexy velvet pallet, and warming mouthwatering finish.  Maybe my favorite Islay malt.","Excellent stuff. Smoky but not too peaty, undertones of charcoal, brine and a lovely sweetness. Dry finish. I am converted.","Wow, I think I may have found a new best friend!","This is the true 'indoors' Islay whisky - the raw elements have been cultivated and brought into the manor house. The 16 year old has depth, is very aromatic, subtle very sherried and herbed. It can't compete with Ardbeg and Laphroaig on peat and smoke but wins through with sheer refinement.","This is simply the stuff of champions.","I found a bottle of Lagavulin 16 YO in the 80s and my Scotch whisky world has not been the same since. This is the one that opened my eyes to the wonderful variety and depth of Scotch single malts. In the mid to late ninties quality was lost. I am happy to report the Lagavulin 16 yo I remember and love is back. This sweet, peaty, malty, briney single malt is magnificently balanced -it may well be the Islay with the best overall balance. I love this stuff.","Introduced to me by my Scottish father in law over a very long evening last Christmas, this really is something to savour. Tremendous and surprisingly good value considering the range of malts we put it up against.","Tip:This improves in the bottle after opening. Savour it over a few months... it gets sweeter","i hated peaty whiskies and therefore had written off Islay whiskies in general.....BUT i was a fool!  this tastes too good to share - the taste couldnt be more different from the nose.","Quite easy drinking this one. Smokey spicy nose, some bite and very reminiscent of a speyside in its core taste. Not a long finish but gives a pleasant hint of smoke. A dry edge lingers on palate. This is very different to say a Laphroaig 10 which is sweeter more rounded and fills the airways with smoke. Both are very good!","I've been fortunate enough to try whiskies from all the current Islay distilleries, even Kilchoman and Port Ellen, but there is just something about Lagavulin 16 that makes it a real classic. PE, Ardbeg, Laphroaig and co. are all fantastic, but the Lagavulin 16 is my choice for introducing others to the Islay whiskies. Brilliantly clean notes of smoke, spice and fruit.","I'd keep a bottle of this to drink, and one for if the world end, and store it right next to the other emergency bottle of Ardbeg Uigeadail.","This got me into Whisky.","Holy guacamole! This is a very serious dram; an awesome display of whisky power! Seasalt, dried fruits, loads of oak, spice, smoke and of course: peat, peat, peat! It seems to linger forever... Its smell still emanated from my glass long after it was empty and even now (morning after) I still taste its woodiness\/smokiness on my palate. Wife kids out of the house, my recliner, my bottle of Lagavulin and a stack of Cheech","I was first introduced to whisky with a gentle Aberlour but soon made my way towards the peaty ones and thought I'd found my favourite with Laphroaig. Nothing else I tried \u2013 Talisker, Bowmore, Jura, you name it \u2013 came close until I was told to give this a try. It has the smokiness of Laphroaig but the flavours are deeper and more complex \u2013 all sorts of things linger and reveal themselves. It's just a classier dram when all's said and done.","First tried Lagavulin after picking up a bottle from duty free on my way to India in 1999 for a business trip. Tried it against many other single malts on a cocanut farm in the Indian tropical rain forest on that visit. It blew my mind away - what an aftertaste compared to the rest. The taste stayed with me and I finally made it to the distillery on Islay one wet Tuesday in 2010 and have a coveted bottle at home - still haven't tasted one quite as good.","A great dram with everything an islay fan would wish for but i think it would be even better at 46% or 50%;it just lacks a little punch.","when i want something deep and rich with great amount of peat flavor, i go for lagavulin. everytime.....","Discoverd at a pub speacialising in fine whiskeys - not looked back since...","A remarkable drink with a huge peaty flavour that demands to be enjoyed neat.","lovin every drop of it","My absolute favourite. And cheap considering how good it is. I got a bottle of the more expensive Distillers Edition for Christmas and it's not as lovely as the standard 16 year. A perfect way to end a day!","I received this as a chritmas gift and it's an absolute treat of a dram.  Intense, smoky, Islay character but a bit more oily and rich than Laphroaig.  I also detected a hint of toffee in the aftertaste probably due to the age (it's six years older than the signature Laphroaig stuff).  An altogether terrific dram for a cold winter's evening - my trusty hillwalking hipflask will appreciate this.","whilst at the langstone cliff dawlish ,i had this single malt whisky,this was a first class malt ,great with a cigar for a christmas treat ,as it states takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth :)","If you have ever wondered what a real malt tastes like, then look no further. this is THE malt of malts...well, that's if you like them peaty!!this is the real deal!","Great review Tom - I like to think it's true......","i was able to savor this fine whisky while on  layover with 2 lufthansa stewardess.need i say more!!","I like to describe my malts by the memories they conger up. Remember those fantastic days in your life book as you snifter away. This malt? Cold damp morning on the grouse moors. Guns in the mist. The smell of fresh gun smoke, wet feathers, wet leather, my wet tweed jacket, the Labrador at my feet, the old Land Rover.","I_know_now: You can certainly try the other strong Islay whiskies like Laphroaig and Ardbeg. Or Bowmore for a slightly less aggressive peaty character. And of course there's always Talisker...","Until I tasted Lagavulin 16 I thought I did not like whisky......it has opened a whole new world for me. My only question now is what single malt should I try next and indeed will any even compare!","Should've posted this a while ago! I didn't 'get' Lagavulin at first. Now I don't understand why that was ever the case! Top notch stuff. ...And the standard 16YO is still the best Lagavulin I've tried.","And I thought JW Green Label was great scotch... but my \"eyes\" opened with Lagavulin 16... Just ordered Laphroaig 10 and Ardbeg 10 to try... I know I'll love them too","A true sweet 16, no doubt. Tantalizingly seductive as it touches the lips, and totally engulfing as it playfully embraces the tongue. The smoky aroma wanders through your mouth cavity dancing with teeth, before it dives into the darkness. Unforgettable encounter of the 16th kind. Love it, absolutely.","The color, the odor, the taste, there is no other like this. They say that teetotal Johnny Depp sometimes orders a dram of Lagavulin and just sniffs it...","this  is a master whisky from islay.peat bomb.salty.you really tast the sea in it.a heavy whisky great for the autumn evenings.and this is one of few whiskys i really like with some water added.","This whisky was my first \"visit\" to Islay. On this evidence, I see no reason to leave any time soon!","Yes a peaty classic. Great nose, robust in the mouth with a stong warming finish that lingers nicely. Very nice indeed.I still rate Laphroaig as my fave Islay, with it's tobacco and snuff box characteristics.","So I got this ( my first ) Islay not knowing if it'd be to my tastes. I like rich Highland or LowlandAll I can say is WOW! Its complex with a taste of everything other posters have said. It's smokey with a great seaside flavour with peat and salt. Strangely there is a menthol\/mintiness to it, but the smoothness stops it from coming through too strong. So far, my fave whisky for me can be described as a very grown-up whisky","Had this for the first time last night... Amazing!!!! This is the malt for me!","Every bit as deep, complex, and wonderful as a'bunadh!!","For myself, the taste of Laphroaig doesnt come near to that of Lagavulin,although i have read somewhere that Homecoming Single Islay Malt does have a similar flavour.","Come on Martin K wake up and get real. Almost everything in life is dearer than it was! Where have you been?","Its a lovely whisky, but used to be able to buy cheap a few years ago when it was still unknown and underrated, has doubled its price in recent years.","On the palate, a silken liquid of considerable viscosity bathes my palate in a gently sweet wood smoke, moving to mint, peppermint and cool menthol. The liquid is warming. There is no heat, burn or roughness of any kind. Have no fear, you can drink this \"neat\" (no water or ice need apply to this job!). I also detect some green olive with the red pimento in the centre coming through. Oh, this is glorious stuff. The stuff that dreams are made of.","Definitely still my best whisky. Always comparing others to him. Still none better. I'm waiting my 1993 distillers edition for this Christmas!","I have tried for years to find a whisky I like better than Lagavulin, I have stopped trying.","What can you say new about Lagavulin 16 yo? It is quite simply in a class of which there are very few members. One of life's great joys is sitting by an open wood fire drinking Laga on a cold winters night. A King amongst Single Malts.","Sorry. Tastes like a visit to a dentist to me.","good choice","This is the King i wonder how much good is then the LAGAVULIN 1991 Distillers Edition","By far the best islay malt i have tasted,lots of smokey peat with a whiff of sea air to finish it off.A truly magnificent dram from the isle that all scotch drinkers should try to have in their collection,for the price(aus.$102.00)it is the best and was well matched with a maduro cigar.","With the same shape bottle and same colour stopper as Caol Ila a strange coincidence ? A pricey dram and I wonder why? The quality is there in the rich nose but doesn't quite follow through onto the palate. Even so a viable alternative to Laphroaig quarter cask and Caol Ila 12 year old. Smokey and rich with sea shore and lapsang overtones.","Wow.  Just wow.  Ardbeg 10YO and Laphroiag Quarter Cask deliver peat in spades, but the overall richness of this is really something else.  Worth every penny.","Was a big fan of Laphroaig, but this whisky has got to be the best I have ever tasted!  Rich, peaty (love that) and more of the sea, seems to me, than Laphroaig.","Outstanding, the best whiskey I've ever tasted or smelled, I'm hooked. Had been drinking Chivas but will never go back. It's like I had been drinking Jose Cuervo and tasted my first agave tequila. Thank you Lagavulin for opening my eyes and nostrils.","Great whisky, complex and rich. But I am a Laphroaig fan.","high five lagavulin. Second favourite whisky in the world.","Hands down the BEST whisky I've ever tasted! I'm addicted!I've put a challenge out there: Can anyone give me a better, richer single malt?In the last 20 years none has been able to accomplish this!","Simply the best of the best of the best. A wonderful, characteristic taste - you can actually feel the atmosphere of the Scottish seaside in your mouth.","A world-beating classic and a whisky I can't live without.  Peaty in a totally different way to Ardbeg and Laphroaig; more of a lapsang souchong nose and taste.  Although wonderful, there's room for improvement: the mouth doesn't quite deliver on what's promised on the nose.  Can't wait to try the Distillers Edition variation on the 16 y-o; it's not that much dearer.","After drinking this I had a Rabbie Burns moment and wrote a poem. This is everything you could want a whisky to be. It's just such a shame mine was a miniature!","A triumph of a whisky!","I have been enjoying all types of whisky for the past 40 odd years as an ex service man. Lagavulin has got to be, with out a doubt, the most enjoyable of the lot. Thank you"],"397":["\nVery well made and very good to drink. Recomended.\n"],"398":["\nThis is rather good.

Too easy to drink, it'll take you by surprise.","First of all, I'm a huge Dalmore fan. This was very polite - almost too polite. Thankfully it's charming and elegant enough to get away with it. The sherry is big and winey but not overpowering like in some Speys (I love that too!). Excellent and complex. Dalmore should bump it up to 46% for those who want a bit more bite though.","Totally blown away by the 15yo. The 12yo was wonderful, but this is so fragrant and gentle.

The 18 year-old has an initial sharpness, not much body and no pleasant or lasting  finish","This is a bonzer whisky, much smoother than Glenlivet and my favourite Speyside.","The Glenfiddich 18 is like a normal 12 year old single malt. It's all relative but Glenfid is lighter than mosy. Not really worth the money and doesn't really taste like 18 year old spirit.","It's not bad but a 12 year old Highland Park would be a better option. Personally I find this 18 year old Glenfiddich too dry on the finish, in that respect it lacks the thick candy sweetness of the Glenfiddich 12.  It's just not all that. Limited complexity, because the dryness dominates and anything else fades away. They seem to have trouble at 18 these Glenfiddichs. This wayward malt should go to boot camp and learn some finesse.","Very rich aromas of fruits and smooth taste.

Do NOT make a mistake and buy the old traditional green triangle bottle of this Whiskey . Old version is sweet with no layers or finish.

Smooth and rich, excellent with a drop or two of water.","Re-review: After emptiing most of the bottle and acquiring new tumblers i'm even more fascinated by this whiskey. \r\nNose: After letting it breath for a few minutes a lovely floral aroma (pears  and apples) overlaced with dense honey sweetnes and some raisins accompanied by gentle barrique type smoke.\r\nPalate: Taste is the reflection of the nose; thick sweet honey and warm tender smoke.\r\nFinish: The finish is rather short and oaky. It rounds up this perfect whiskey.\r\nI would give it 9,3\/10 an exellent value for money, especially.","Just amazing. I always have a bottle at home. Hope they don't raise the price!","I made the biggest mistake of all times... Comparing this to Glenmorangie 18!\r\nSuch a sweet & smooth expression as Glenmo 18 neat, got me really confused ''cause I pretended to drink Fiddich 18 neat which was a major mistake... There''s no room for ice in the first one, however Fiddich 18 opens up wonderfully when wattered down a bit, having it straight from the bottle could be some sort of a bad decision, it brings a huge alcohol kick that wont let you take advantage of its complexity, so \r\nadd two ice cubes for experiencing one of the best single malts out there!","One of the best Whiskies on the market to date everything about it pure luxury and pure class. It amazes me that people say the 15 is better. there seriously must be something wrong with all you peoples taste buds because this tastes far more luxurious than the 15 year old.","Nose: Very floral and exeptionally strong, I smell william''s pear, vanilla, oak and some aromas I can''t identify\nTaste: Very oaky and refreshing, some of the fresh floral notes from the nose turn up. It''s not at all sweet and it has a magnificient warming oaky finish, that lingers on the tounge for queit some time. \nOverall it''s a very wonderful whiskey for the price.","Nose - banana, vanilla, fresh green apples and oak with a hint of furniture polish. Palate - Fresh fruit with apple and pear and hints of xmas cake.\nFinish - Long and dry with spice, a little rum and raisin.\n\nLovely whisky, one  of my favourites.","Bananas and vanilla fudge...does anyone else get that?

Tastes delicious, rich sherry, dried fruits and subtle malt.  The finish is good with a little spice but comes up a bit short.

Enjoy!","The only thing this whisky needs is a glass to put it in!","I agree with some of the other reviewers - this is a great whisky. It bears the unmistakable distillery hallmarks and is very smooth for a 57% peated whisky (in a good way). Perhaps a bit sweeter and not as peppery as the 10 YO but equally good in a slightly different hue. Mood alone determines whether I prefer the 10 YO or 57 North. I prefer both to the 18 YO and Distiller's Edition but still rank those versions as some of my favourite whiskies.","Have just reviewed this and thoroughly enjoyed. Different to the 10 year old, unmistakably Talisker and a power house at cask strength. I will definately return to this bottling again, but I have to move on to others to try!","Just visited the distillery and bought a bottle of this home.

At 57% it has the raw power to go with the great Islay's...and then some.","Even though it's 57? it's very smooth. Typical Talisker flavours are found here, but turned upside-down: less chilli-pepper and more smoke. I like it, but I still prefer the fieriness of the 10Y.","Well, this is indeed one my favorites whiskies at the moment. But, I prefer it straight despite it being bottled at almost cask strength. I honestly prefer it without any water added. It is indeed smoother than the regular 10 yo Talisker, with the very characteristic flavors of Talisker and thus an unmistakable and unforgettable flavor.

Its a fantastic whisky, but the \"standard\" Talisker is so good, I'm not sure 57 North is better.

I think the 10 is robust, packs the right amount of peat with a monster peppery finish. The Talisker 18 is arguably the finest dram I have ever had including all the big ones under 200 dollars. The Talisker SE fits right in between. I agree with the previous reviews. Fantastic fruity nose with a hint of smoke, great mouth feel, wonderful balance and a delicate smoke and pepper and a lovely sweetness on the finish. Could get into trouble with this one!\n","\nA great case of smoke with a hint of sweetness. Definitely a worthwhile buy\n","\nThis is an awesome expression of Talisker. It has that great Talisker mouth feel and maritime taste we all love but with a touch of refined sweetness from the sherry casks. The sweetness is in the aftertaste though, don't get this confused with a sherry monster. At 11 years and 90 proof it's a good deal.\n","\nI first tasted this on the tour at the Talisker distillery, and just had to have a bottle. I got a nice sweet taste but still with that unique Talisker taste, a little bit less on the smoke\/peat than the 10 year old.\n","\n15 of us did a tasting of 12 whiskeys and this one clearly marked higher than any other. The smell is that of orange (which in our mind was a perfect balance) and the taste had a balance of smoke that none could match. This is by far my new whiskey.\n","\nBanana on the nose, briny and slightly lemony on the tongue, sweet long finish, this is a whisky that plays well against bottles at double the price. We had it on a blind taste at the whisky of the year tasting event, and it was a clear winner seeing how people were talking about it.\n","\nTalisker with two sugars.

The sherry clashes heavily with the peatiness of the scotch. Unlike Bruichladdich's Port Charlotte, where the sherry and peatiness compliment each other, this whisky doesn't have good balance and feels all over the place.\nOf course, just my two cents. Best thing is to try before you buy.\n","\nSlightly smoky with a taste of iodine.\n","\nNot my favourite Laphroaig tbh. Have given the spirit plenty of time to air in the bottle now half full and in the glass for a couple of hours. I wonder if the sherry cask is simply seasoned as the PX is not as strong and powerful in terms of fruitcake and Xmas cake as other expressions matured in pure Sherry butts. Iodine is strong and overpowers the cask surprisingly, also the smoke is not strong, actually disappointingly weak compared to other expressions from this distillery. The Ortho and Meta Cresols are strong, which is characteristic of Laphroaig due to the low kiln temperature in the initial smoking period, but IMO the smokiness has been sacrificed in this expression.\nNot my favourite Laphroaig and not a patch IMO on the cheaper by far superior NAS Quarter Cask. Again I would ask, is this a sherry butt with insufficient maturation time allocation or simply a seasoned cask?\n","\n We bought this scotch in St. Thomas initially and loved it so much we wanted more.

It's clear that the flavor is not as direct as the nose was hinting to me.\nFinish\nWarming. That light smoke from before surrounds the end and really rides out the flavor.

As a relative newbie, therefore, one of the simplest dimensions of distinction is whether one is an Islay person or not. The Dalmore is definitely a whisky for those in the \"not Islay\" camp. I'd venture as far as to say it's the canonical non-Islay scotch. Not peaty or noticeably smoky at all, but still possessing the rich caramel, vanilla, toffee notes along with a mildly spicy touch.\nIt is one of those rare expressions that starts smooth, stays smooth and finishes smooth. Now, smooth doesn't mean devoid of complexity. The 18 expression is sweeter and smoother than it's 15-year-old sibling, and it makes for a top notch pour over nothing. If you do feel compelled, though, add a cube of ice, not water. You want the perfectly balanced texture to be diluted gradually, not instantly.\nI read about some color being added or this not being non-chill filtered - doesn't matter much, to my palate at least.\nIf there's further need to justify my rating, how about this - I first tried Dalmore 18 at a quaint restaurant in the Highlands during my trip to Scotland and fell in love with it; when I returned States-side I realized it costs at least twice if not more as it costs in the UK. Therefore, even with shipping included, I get a better deal at Whiskey Exchange than anywhere local (assuming it's even available).

It is balanced, offers incredible complexity and lingers on the palate for a long time. It's great value for money as well, delivering what very few whiskies at the same price point can.","Over the last 25 years, I've tasted whisky from about 60% of the working distilleries in Scotland, most of the blends, and a handful of Japanese and American whiskies.  Highland Park 18 YO is simply the greatest whisky I have ever tasted.  Magnificent nose, a palate that is both complex and balanced, and a finish like no other.  a sublime experience bottle after bottle.","The balance is the key to the glory of this whisky.  The fruit, honey and smoke exist in perfect harmony.  It's amazing that not only do they create such a balance, but can reproduce it consistently from bottle to bottle.  Bravo!","Tasted this while on a couple of days holiday at the Forest Hills Hotel Loch Aird.

It is a bit like some of the better Japanese whiskies - but seems a tad more authentic and a lot cheaper! \u00a350 very well spent!","Perfect, a beautiful dram!","An easygoing single malt with smoke, salt and sweetness all in a perfect balance. Indeed, unless you heavily dislike smokiness or saltiness, you'll certainly find Highland Park 18yo at least drinkable. However, whether or not you'll love it will depend fully on how much you appreciate this kind of smoothness. Personally, I tend to prefer more adventurous, rougher whiskies. 8 out of 10","While this one is too good to (care to) describe, I will try... The smell: stables and leather, glue, autumn leaves. The taste: nuts, smoky wood, vanilla, a pinch of ginger and peat; sweet but not too sweet.Awesome.","Totally agree with Tudval. This is a very good malt, but what is wrong with rough edges? If I want something easy going I'll buy a bottle of blended.","Palate (undiluted):  Rich, luxurious honey\/toffee flavors interwoven with nuts, spicy cinnamon, pretzel salt and the perfect hint of peat fill the palate. A chewy dram drying towards the finish. No sharp edges here. No bite, bitterness or burn here. Peat is present but not overwhelming or dominating. It compliments the flavor profile only.  Finish undiluted):  A big, rounded finish of lingering smoke, spices verging on peppercorns.","HP 18yo is excellent! Has the most beautiful vintage floral fruity nose, and it won't disappoint on the taste. Gives a surprising fire burn, then off to smoother notes again. Just a beautiful dram!","I must disagree with most reviews. I don't mind rough edges and I sometimes prefer younger whiskies to old. This is one such case.   True, it's extremely smooth, but also a bit too sweet for me. More of a dessert, it has it's place, but one cannot say 'it's the best' or 'you cannot go wrong'.","We all want smoke and umber and fire..but this is the best of all rolled into one. there is the deep golden  \"here comes the sun\"colour. the taste is that of the rarest sweetest honey.

It''s a lovely rich mature dram that''s all too easy to drink. Of course, there''s no peat or smoke, so others may get more out of some of the Speyside cousins but as a pure expression of a highland malt- with the emphasis on the malt, this can''t be beaten.  I would however suggest that as a magnificent expression of the distillery, you might want to try the younger cask strength version. Pure butterscotch, it''s a cracker!","I'm drinking a dram of this as I write this.  I bought the bottle on my last trip to Aberdeen.  This is a delicious single malt with very complex flavor.  Floral, wood, spice and nuts.  Wonderfully mild and complex finish as well!  As The Flying Scotsman says above, it has a very festive flavor that would fit quite well after a Scotch drinker's Christmas dinner.","Rich amber color, full bodied, may need just a touch of water to open and bring it down from 86 proof. Highly recommended at the price; would love to afford to drink it every day. Online notes tout the nose, but I did not notice it as exceptional. But on the palate... that was something else.","Another festive 'must' for your Christmas dram cupboard, picked up a bottle in Kiev, this dram is robust, and its maturity gives it a big, bold, yet mellow sherry kick. Stewed pears and red apples in here??? Oh yes, I think so! Enjoy responsibly. Slanje...","Was very impressed with this. Loads of flavours and a great finish. Try leaving your emptied glass out overnight and smell it in the morning. Lovely!","Bought a bottle for my father in-laws 60th birthday.  Thought he wasnt going to open it for a second!

No need for detailed drawn out review. If this is in your budget, get it. You wont regret it","The major drawback of this whisky is that it is too easy to drink. The nose is almost a bit too sweet, but not cloying indeed. It goes down with no sense of burning at all and leaves a well balanced persisting taste. A rounder alternative to the great super-masculine peaties","Powerful nose.  I was at a restaurant.  I had to keep swatting at a fruitfly.  It eventually ended up in my glass and drowned.  (What a way to go).  Fortunately my drink was graciously replaced. Very enjoyable.","I really liked this young adult dram and am looking forward to it tonight. Great raisin sweetness , star anise, smooth nutmeg oak flavor. Compact with a nice finish and subtle vanilla impact.

A school teacher of whisky teaching me an amazing development of smoothness and dryness while still wetting my taste buds from honeyed dehydrated fruit and balanced spice.

Just wow !.  Absaloubtly stunning and amazing, how this malt can evoke such emotions and it''s a honor to be able to exsperiance such a dram of this stature and refinement just remember for every year of age on a malt whisky you should leave it stand for a minuit per each year and I wouldent recommend adding a tea spoon of water in this one as there is more aroma and flavour un watered like I said above just leave it stand a min per year and best of all enjoy it with a friend or family member !","I bought a bottle at Singapore Airport, for my price range it's the very best & smooth malt scotch whisky I've ever had, plus when I arrived home I found I had a bottle of the same already.  So one half glass a week is going to last much longer than I thought.","Simply the best whisky I've ever had.

The second bottle was a real disappointment, had non of these qualities and was a little subdued, almost flat in flavour and alcohol.","Excellent!  I enjoy the original .","I found this disappointing considering the rave reviews it's gotten. A glass of this shared the table with a Glenfarclas 21, a Dailuaine 27 from Adelphi, Brora 2003 and Port Ellen 7th release, and the Signet couldn't beat any of them. A sort of a charred, coffe aroma-enrichened Glenmorangie but not particularly complex or rich. For this rather heavy price more value is easy to find.","Phenomenal dram from the Glenmorangie distillery. Whether Signet deserves its price tag argument being completely customer-dependent -thus, relative, this is the very dram which Glenmorangie has outdone itself, that's for sure! Fancy packaging is not to be criticized for the very same reason either, because a dram that is so unique and fabulous certainly deserves to be spoiled also in this regard. Well done, Glenmorangie.","La experiencia de un Signet se recuerda toda la vida. Es indudablemente una obra de arte de la casa Glenmorangie.","The holy grail of whisky. Well behaved and full of chocolate,dark sugars and fruit and leaves a velvet covering on the tongue like chocolate does which no doubt is the combination of the rare high roast malt and single estate cadboll barley with a generous helping of the vast and precious wealth of knoll-age the sixteen men of Tain have.\nWhisky this good usually commands much more money so in my eyes it's a steel at this price !.","My friends and I hold whisky gatherings at least 3-4 times a year, one of our flock has a liking for glenmorangie and has presented us with a long line of relatively uninteresting commercial tasting specimens so I wasnt expecting much from the Signet but oh boy was I wrong, this has got to be in my top three malts ive tasted for many a bottle, far better than even the Old Pulteney 21 Mr Murray just awarded top swig of 2012 (a bottle we also had at the same sitting).","Got a bottle of this as a present today. I am not  whisky drinker but after reading the reviews I cannot wait to get home and pour a glass. Thankfully I am off work tomorrow.","To my mind a dram designed more for the Asian export markets, or for those new to drinking whisky. Far too sweet and chocolatey for my tastes. I opened a bottle with a few members of the SMWS with great fanfare, but sadly there was no interest in a second helpings.","I have a glass of this in my hand as I write this, and although I think packaging which is undoubtedly beautiful has increased the price it is still a fantastic whisky! I'm waiting for my bottle of sonnalta px to compare as there's a good \u00a340 in the price difference! All scepticism aside I'd buy this again, but everyone's palates are different so is a review really gospel to go by???","An undeniably good whisky, but I couldn't help feeling I was paying more for the sumptuous packaging. There are better GM's available at a more attractive price.","Last night at an engagement party I tasted Glenlivet 21, Glenfiddich 21, Johnny Walker blue label. All three together didn't compare to Glenmorangie Signet a taste of heaven! Smooth with fantastic taste and flavors . I've been dreaming about it all day!","One of the best i ever had,surely will buy more!","I also know more about whisky than James Saxon. This whisky is truly wonderful, and is equal to the finest Japanese malts. It is called a chocolate malt for good reason - it has a rich sweetness and is incredibly smooth, and is worth every penny","Last night i opened my 3cl sample bottle, i now wish i had bought the full size bottle. It was the best i have tried for a long time.","This is seriously one of the best whisky's I have tried to date. Amazing nose followed by this dark chocolate palate and as you keep drinking it more and more characteristics develop. I only share it with my good friends and then they only ever get a sip! So happy I bought this one!","I have just returned from a tour of the glenmorangie distillery and having tasted this whiskey after the tour i must say... this is one of the best whiskeys i have ever tasted. Not too peated but enough that you can taste it, heavenly chocolate with a finish of caramel and burned toast.

I consider myself to be educated as far as whisky is concerned (I am the Chairman of our local whisky club). Therefore I have to say James Saxon is very wrong.

Fruits more pear, Apple, than dried fruits. Personally, not picking mch dried fruit myself and I suspect perhaps a Fino variation. Tangy lemon, green olive and grape more than dried fruit to my palate. Colour could come from allowing the flor to die.

Imaginative finish IMO.\n","\nI drank this against 9 other Ardbegs several other top Islays in a very unusual context in Odessa, where for reasons I can't go in to there was a genuine concern that I was about to be in very serious trouble and possible physical danger. Stood out as the best of an excellent bunch and is certainly now my final supper whisky - if I ever find myself on death row this will definitely be my last round...\n","\nThin coatline with small beads and legs run slowly reflecting low oil content and higher ABV.\nColour slightly darker than 10 year old, suggesting a very short finish in a sherry cask, unless of course that was a Fino sherry and accompanying dryness which is present, but I suspect Oloroso.\nNose - slighter smoke than usual, chocolate hit, ashy and some gunpowder,, slight dried fruits mainly raisin, slight hint of banana and pear reflecting isoamyl acetate. A licorice background. Slight inside of a teapot aroma. The feinty aromas are typical of the Kildaltons and not surprising given that 60% of the phenols are in the feints.\nPalate - salty, peat smoke is quite strong, chilli and pepper from 1st fill American Casks. A bit of a wolf in sheets clothing given the reduced Ardbeg smokiness in the nose.\nFinish - slightly smoke, slightly sweet, tannic, medium length\nConclusion - is it worth the money? Not in comparison to other Ardbegs, but I have just opened the bottle and to be fair it will probably sharpen up considerably. I prefer the 10 year old over any of the other Ardbegs and Corryvreckan, Uigeadail and Dark Cove over this NAS. Still a nice enough peated whisky and more gentle than most others of the Kildalton strains.\n","\ni drank a boytle of this whosky.....i have to say it was yje best ardbeg i jave tried and i tried them all\n","\nLovely whisky looking forward to getting another bottle\n","\nI'm a fan of Ardbeg but not this release.

When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit.\n90 Points\n","126":null,"127":null,"128":null,"129":null,"130":"\nTasting notes by Billy A\nNose: Crunchie bars, Eccles cakes, a touch of rubber, black liquorice, brown sugar, vanilla cream, Victoria sponge, berries and foresty hints \u2013 rich earth and damp green leaves.\nPalate: An oily mouthfeel with caramel, pepper and stewed oranges up front, and sherbert and milk chocolate coming in behind. \nFinish: Medium length, with sweet wood turning slowly dry and spicy, with a burst of spiced butter fading to lightly bitter barrel char.\nComment: A solid and tasty sherry-cask-matured whisky.

The darker flavours fade, leaving anise, apple, green grass and a hint of riverbank earth.\nComment: A Laphroaig that definitely fulfils the brief \u2013 it's rich.

Crunchy textured walnuts follow, oozing into golden honeycomb that trickles over sun-ripened sticky dates.

Raspberry and cherry, with Turkish delight and smoky driftwood embers burst from the glass jostling for attention. There is a distinctly summer feel to this dram, no brooding peat monster it has a light, bright and fruity air. As the whisky opens you find the Islay sea breeze, ozone and salty. The oak, both American and French give real depth to the dram, classic vanilla, toasted bread, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, liquorice walnut and almond. Each time you go back to the glass there seems to be a bubble of red berry and ripe plum bursting under your nose.\nPalate: Certainly warming at 59.2%, lively and sweet with icing sugar and marshmallow, bound in smoke. There is a rush to capture all that is taking place. Sweet red fruit and peat smoke melt away slightly as the power of the oak comes through with tobacco leaf and toasted oak. Maple syrup, pecan and coffee are complimented by hints of orange and cooked peach. There is a complexity here that didn\u2019t seem possible on the first sip. As you go back to the glass that initial rush of flavour has become a more complete experience. Nowthere is salt spray, dry smoke and the oak is more prominent, raspberry and plum combine with vanilla and butterscotch.\nFinish: On the finish the peat smoke is a little more medicinal than normal, think bandages and creosote. A dryness from the oak tells of the toasting of the French and the char of the American and the final combination in premium French oak together. The influence of the extra maturation in sumptuous first growth casks has added a layer of fruit that weaves its way through the smoke and into the heart of the whisky. The spirit is viscous and textured allowing a long finish where creamy vanilla, spicy clove and ripe peach melt away from the powerful peat smoke allowing it to finish alone, leaving the Port Charlotte DNA firmly in place.\nCharacter: Lively, sunny, rosy, a wonderful experience and superb combination of fruit laden French oak, strong peat smoke and Islay maturation.\n","622":null,"623":null,"624":"\nProducer's Notes\nNose: A summer fruit basket full of plums, pears and peaches with sweet malted barley.\nPalate: Wonderfully sweet with caramelised apples, blackcurrants and a light cinnamon spice.\nFinish: Medium-long moving to toasted wood, sugared rhubarb and milk chocolate.\n\u2013Cara Laing\n","625":"\nTasting Notes by The Whisky Exchange\nNose: Rich aromas of candied fruit, with creamy almonds, Christmas cake, green apple and pear.\nPalate: Concentrated dried fruit, toasty oak, milk chocolate and burnt sugar with biscuit hints.\nFinish: The creaminess mingles with the rich fruit.\n","626":null,"627":"\nTasting Notes by the Whisky Exchange\nNose: Dark chocolate and glac\u00e9 cherries, with apple and creamy vanilla-infused cr\u00eame br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\nPalate: Thick and fruit, with cream, stewed apple, candied orange and sweet vanilla.\nFinish: Dry, with lingering spice.\n","628":"\nTasting Notes by Rocky\nNose: Rich and pronounced fresh-fruit notes: apple, pineapple and papaya, with malt and toffee in the background, along with a hint of cinnamon. \nPalate: The richness continues, but with the fruit notes of apple and pineapple superseded by prominent notes of nut and spice: hazelnut, nutmeg and clove. \nFinish: Medium to long, with the fruit and nut slowly dissipating to leave the spicy flavours. \nComment: A rich and spicy whisky, with the added complexity that the additional year\u2019s maturation gives, compared to its predecessor.

Sweet yellow fruits, drizzled with honey and crushed almonds, intertwine wonderfully with freshly picked summer flowers; together they rise serenely on the first pass. It\u2019s a beautiful experience. Then, with a little aeration, it's custard cream and toasted barley, banana bread and vanilla fudge. Marzipan continues to rise, now mingling with a citric twist created by the big sleep beside the Atlantic ocean. The final notes are of the malt and oak, evolving together over 22 years, with the aromatics hinting at the natural beauty of this special place called Islay.\nPalate: At first you feel the power of the spirit. Its taste spectrum is intriguing, with flavours coming together like the threads of a fine tweed. The harmonious aromatics have merged superbly to give a mouth-feel that is the absolute single malt taste experience. The vanilla oak and lemon and honey lead on the first sips, with the soft, yogurt-like fruit flavours a heartbeat behind. Then it\u2019s that brilliant Abernethy Biscuit, a vanilla wafer, and then sparkling like a firecracker all around the taste buds comes that marine citrus meringue flavour.

How blessed are you?\nColour: Cadmium yellow\/ jasmine\nNose: Blazing peat fires send sparks of joy onto the unsuspecting olfactory system captivating and ravishing the senses which have never had such natural pleasure.

The fruits balance the marine notes; the oaky nutty ginger flavours combat the peat and the citrus helps cool the heat of the fire. Perfect balance.\nFinish: The heat from the peat embers will warm the soul into the wee small hours and as you awaken next morning your senses will ask: \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d, hoping with all your heart that it will happen again.\nMood: Close your eyes as you inhale, you will be spiritually transported to the island of great distillers, with a terroir unique and natural where the never-ending call of the sea is the anthem of the Ileach.\u00a0\n","1098":null,"1099":null,"1100":null,"1101":null,"1102":null,"1103":null,"1104":null,"1105":"\nTasting Notes by Rocky\nNose: Rich with spicy oak at first, followed by heather, toffee popcorn and dry honey.\nPalate: Warming with the spicy oak still present, along with marmalade.

Also highly unusual notes of green olives that we never got in any Talisker as far as we can remember. The peat is less \u2018ashy and sooty\u2019, and probably grassier and more organic. With water: it got even straighter, on a pure mix of seawater and lemon juice. Make that a plate of oysters. Mouth (neat): again, what\u2019s striking is that there\u2019s much more lemon and even lime in this \u2018new\u2019 one. Very citric and then certainly peatier than the oldies. Also very peppery, but it\u2019s different pepper when compared with the exceptional 1952. Sharper and also more mineral. With water: it does not get any rounder but, interestingly, closer to the oldies, with these heavy notes of shoe polish that we found in the 1953. Also notes of fresh almonds and always a lot of lemon. Finish: long, heavily \u2018coastal\u2019 now, with the \u2018lemony peat\u2019 striking at the end. Faint tannins (grape skin). Comments: these recent 20 or 25yo Taliskers are all very good and except for wood type variations (there has been some sherry versions), they are all very consistent.

Mouth-warming chilli spice prickles the palate evolving into lingering cracked black pepper notes. Rounded\u00a0and rich, as they combine and mature into tropical fruit flavours \u2013 ripe banana and kiwi included. The bitter decadence of dark chocolate adds a fascinating depth. This Longmorn is intricately layered, as the robust sweetness dissipates, a grounding earthiness comes to the fore with the lightest of touches of distinctive coriander and lingering hints of peat smoke in the background.Finish: Smooth, creamy, and satisfying. The incredible Longmorn spirit has developed nicely in the European Oak Sherry cask; the marriage of the two stays with you, for a long time, with an enjoyably fruity finish.With water:\u00a0The warming spice is mellowed and the creaminess becomes more pronounced. The malt is sweeter, more defined fruit notes, really bringing out more of the Sherry hogshead\u2019s influences. The orange peel notes have mellowed slightly, while milk chocolate and cocoa become more prominent, and then, to finish it off, hints of coffee. The palate is softer now; the vivid fruitiness has matured into ripe banana, summer peach, and plump and juicy raspberry. There is an underlying vanilla pod intricacy throughout.\n","2771":null,"2772":null,"2773":null,"2774":null,"2775":null},"url":{"0":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/41219\/glenrothes-2001-bot2014-small-bottle\n","1":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/43441\/glenrothes-select-reserve-small-bottle\n","2":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/43442\/glenrothes-vintage-reserve-small-bottle\n","3":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/47793\/bowmore-12-year-old-small-bottle\n","4":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/22412\/glenfiddich-12-year-old-small-bottle\n","5":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/14783\/glenkinchie-12-year-old-small-bottle\n","6":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/1485\/cragganmore-12-year-old-small-bottle\n","7":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/4838\/talisker-10-year-old-small-bottle\n","8":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/5431\/dalwhinnie-15-year-old-small-bottle\n","9":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/9451\/clynelish-14-year-old-small-bottle\n","10":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/13318\/benromach-10-year-old-small-bottle\n","11":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/5300\/balvenie-12-year-old-double-wood-small-bottle\n","12":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/11252\/edradour-10-year-old-small-bottle\n","13":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/20753\/glengoyne-10-year-old-small-bottle\n","14":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/37299\/glenfarclas-10-year-old-small-bottle\n","15":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/8353\/caol-ila-12-year-old-small-bottle\n","16":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/30213\/kingsbarns-spirit-drink\n","17":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/17401\/old-pulteney-12-year-old-half-bottle\n","18":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/27284\/bruichladdich-classic-laddie-scottish-barley-small-bottle\n","19":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/6077\/oban-14-year-old-small-bottle\n","20":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/33891\/oban-14-year-old-small-bottle\n","21":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/10723\/glenfiddich-15-year-old-small-bottle\n","22":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/24918\/tomatin-cu-bocan-small-bottle\n","23":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/47794\/bowmore-darkest-15-year-old-small-bottle\n","24":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/6999\/lagavulin-16-year-old-small-bottle\n","25":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/38849\/glenfarclas-12-year-old-half-bottle\n","26":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/41220\/glenrothes-1991-bot2012-small-bottle\n","27":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/22388\/glenfiddich-12-year-old-half-bottle\n","28":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/37300\/glenfarclas-105-small-bottle\n","29":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/28823\/glenlivet-12-year-old-half-bottle\n","30":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/2562\/glen-moray-classic\n","31":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/12971\/glen-grant-the-majors-reserve\n","32":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/2443\/glenmorangie-10-year-old-half-bottle\n","33":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/17353\/bowmore-12-year-old-half-bottle\n","34":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/10994\/speyburn-bradan-orach\n","35":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/39120\/kilchoman-sanaig-small-bottle\n","36":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/30157\/loch-lomond-original\n","37":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/33705\/tomatin-legacy-bourbon-virgin-oak\n","38":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/30061\/glen-moray-port-cask-finish\n","39":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/30062\/glen-moray-peated\n","40":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/34586\/glen-moray-sherry-cask-finish\n","41":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/34329\/tomintoul-tlath\n","42":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/33036\/glencadam-origin-1825-sherry-cask-finish\n","43":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/47795\/bowmore-18-year-old-small-bottle\n","44":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/40839\/glen-keith-distillery-edition\n","45":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/4937\/tomintoul-10-year-old\n","46":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/16821\/glen-moray-10-year-old-chardonnay-cask\n","47":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/26000\/auchentoshan-american-oak\n","48":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/29984\/finlaggan-old-reserve-small-batch-islay-malt\n","49":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/37962\/glen-moray-peated-glass-set\n","50":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/37963\/glen-moray-classic-glass-set\n","51":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/37964\/glen-moray-port-cask-finish-glass-set\n","52":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/39598\/glenallachie-distillery-edition\n","53":"https:\/\/www.thewhiskyexchange.com\/\/p\/42714\/john-crabbie-8-year-old\n","54":"https:\/\/www.th
