I've tasted lots of single malt scotches, to the point of boring anyone to tears with descriptions of nose, taste, finish, etc.  Suffice it to say that Glenfiddichs is good, and dependable, and affordable.  Main nose is pear and fruitiness;  the remainder is pretty typical Speyside single malt.  Forget the single malt snobs who denigrate it.  Glenfiddich is an affordable single malt (especially in the 1.75 litre size) which is good and drinkable.  Pear and fruity notes predominate.  Forget the snobs and enjoy a single malt at a decent price.", "Rating": 4}, {"Author": " Gregory", "PostedOn": "23 October 2017", "Review": "I'm 47.  Been drinking whisky since 30.

It was smooth and aromatic. It was a bit sweet buttery and spicy on the nose.  The  palate was extremely smooth and thick, very soft. It was a bit sharp but not unpleasant on the finish very warm and spicy but sweet. It is a very good dram with a lot of history and tradition.

I was treated to a scotch tasting at the Indy Scottish games a couple of years ago and was thrilled to explore the a ubundance of flavors and feels. After I heard the prices, I asked for a tasting of scotches from $30-$50.even though it was humorous it was a bit tongue in cheek, with a lot of truth from my wallet. Fast forward a year or so and I ran into a balviene double wood. I had some, and I had some more letting my glenmoragie, another decent price brand, fill the glasses of my friends in the band, and spoiled my self on the Balviene. When I went to buy some it was at a difficult price to explain to my wife albeit very moderate for a good single malt. As I looked at the offerings, I noticed the arberlour 12, and saw the same double cask process described, and after a bit of questioning the clerks who knew little about it, I just bit the bullet and bought another scotch, taste unknown, at $20 less hoping for the best. Little did I know that I had made my best scotch decision of my first year of scotch discovery. It's a great malt smooth and full of flavors, sweet and aromatic, soft on the palate, mild and spicy, with a tremendous flavor of sweet fruits and flowers in a long finish well after swallowing. An awesome scotch value and flavor. This is a single malt in my previously mentioned price range that will find a place in my limited liquor stocks for some time. By the way I took the first bottle to a gathering of my friends in the band and got about 2 drams before I went to get a plate of food. When I got back to the studio the arberlour was gone and I was offered as much \"famous grouse red\" as I wanted, a great blend in itself. I just recently ran into \"black and white\" as well.

Many people associate with medicine, and I could see that. The smoke was overpowering and downright cruel. After a few minutes I took a sip. A few minutes later I took another. As I got used to the whisky, the whisky got used to me. My lesson would be, you can't just jump on this whisky. You have to let it creep up on you. treat it with respect, give it time to open up, don't expect it to be anything it's not. I kept coming back to it over and over, and by the time I was done it was like an old friend. I could taste it walking down the road home 20 minutes later. Even the finish seems to change, becoming richer, that lingering smoke almost chewy. \n\nThis is a fantastic whisky for it's price. It should be tried by everyone, loved by few, hated by some, but never leaving anyone undecided. Just give it a second, third and fourth chance and, who knows, it may change your mind. A poor man's Lagavulin 16, this makes a fine addition to any collection.

It was ever so distinctive, oily almost with that nose of iodine / medicine / TCP / bandages. Judging by the bottle I bought yesterday, it seems this has been really dialled down, presumably to make it more marketable to a broader audience. It was super-smoked and seemed sweeter than in the past, an almost maple syrup or caramel in the aftertaste. The smoke and peat are obvious crowd pleasers, and, although a little too much so for my taste, the sweetness too. But those trademark iodine / bandages /  medicinal notes and that oiliness which so polarised whisky lovers, and for me made it such a unique dram, seemed barely there.

Fruity, citrusy, and then something odd ... something that waffles between 3 things: over-ripe pears, waaaay over-ripe even rotting fruit (reminding me of something from the tropics but I can't place it), and a somewhat unpleasant chemical smell (but not taste) in the back of the throat/nose.  It's the last one that makes me give it 3 instead of 4 stars.  Below, someone panned this whisky saying it had a glue like finish.  I don' think the smell I'm getting is glue, but perhaps this is what he was referring to.  Long, somewhat woody finish (older drier wood), but not unpleasant as that might sound.

I sense some whiskys older than 15 years old have been used in this too. I used to really enjoy the Dalwhinnie 15 year old, with its delicate honey and lime zest. This one completely obliterates the delicate touch of what I had come to regard as the Dalwhinnie character. I had thought the whole point of Dalwhinnie was to avoid heavy rich flavours, to retain that lightness of touch.  I read a review which said if you like Clynelish, you will like this. It is certainly bordering on Clynelish or maybe more Old Pulteney 17 year old. It really isn't bad whisky, there is none of that cheap sweetness that you can associate with 'modern oak', it is still a classy product but for me, 'Dalwhinnie it ain't'.

On the palate - remarkably smooth and less hot than many an older whisky.  At 48% very approachable.  The impressions from the nose carry through here, with some brine and peat coming through.\n\nA few drops of water &  little time to breath - on the nose - softens the slight medicinal notes but brings the smoke forward.  All those (Strepsil) lemon cough lozenger notes on the neat nose now right there on the palette.  Sweetness, lemon balm, then coal tar soap,  Army & Navy sweets. A long, dry, warm finish, barbeque smoke, phenolic, salty finish.\n\nThis one is a hit! After the disappointment of the Select, a very good companion alongside the classic 10. A little less of the in your face swagger of the 10. But this is no pale imitation.\n\n48% abv, Non-chill filtered - yeah well done Laphroaig!

I first started my single malt journey with Dahlwinnie which got me to forever give up blended scotch whiskey. Then I was introduced to Macallans and I thought there's no further to go; 12 year, 18 year, cask strength and even 25 year at a Times Square pub in NYC no less! Periodically I'd go back to Dahlwinnie or have Highland Park but I thought Macallans was it. The Dalmore (12 year) is smoother and needs no water or ice (thank the gods!) than all the Macallans except perhaps the 25 year. I LOVE this single malt: the nose, the start, the middle and the finish don't disappoint.

My first introduction to Scotch was The Glen livet 12, and 15, which were okay. Than the McCallan 12 (and also 15 I believe) which were also just okay  as well. Than GlenMorangie 10 year which was a bit too mellow and fruity for me, not very complex. Then I found AUCHENTOSHAN THREE WOOD (which had no indication as to how old it was) this is THE CHAMP!!! This is the best cognac like Scotch, yet more complex with better and more variety of flavor notes. I won't go into all the different flavors, it seems to vary among different individuals. All I have to say is if you like sweet and malty notes (among others), rich and complex, but smooth with just enough bite, this is it.  Thank You Auchentoshan now lower the price a bit $58 for 750ml makes me limit my consumption.
