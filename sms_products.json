Firstly, this expression doesn't claim to be a 5* malt nor is it a peaty island malt so it's pointless comparing with suchlike. So what do we have? To my taste, a fairly light, rounded lowland malt; toffee coconut on the nose, soft with whatever mellow fruit you care to mention in taste. Lovely for a starter in the early evening but not robust enough for after-dinner. Overall I would rate it as 2* or maybe 3* overall, compared with more expensive malts but in terms of vfm I give it 5* - so I've given it 3* as a sort of compromise.\n"]}

I have read all the reviews and for the life of me don't understand where all the straight alcohol overpowering people are coming from. It is incredibly smooth and complex. I will be buying many more bottles in the future love it.\n", "\nHere in the US it's 43%. And under $25 before tax. I first heard about it (and also Old Pulteney) from a certain Youtube personality/institution who tends to wear a plaid jacket and a Scotch bonnet, who said that it is \"everything Glenlivet should be\". And I like Glenlivet 12, but only buy it on sale. When basic \"glens\" aren't on sale I'd rather spend more and try a premium malt.\nI won't get into tasting notes, but I've given this as gift to malt newbies and it's a great budget intro (it costs way more in other states). I tend to keep one in my cabinet for those occasions when I don't want to deplete other bottles. Sure, I love my Islays as well as Craigellachie, Aberlour, Highland Park, Macallan, and I like 46% and no chill filtration and no colorant, but I also like value. This and Old Pulteney 12 are well-kept secrets, I almost fear talking about it :)\nMy rating of 5 stars is based on value. It's not the most complex or unique malt, but it's full-bodied. Don't spend on it more than on Glenmorangie 10 or Old Pulteney 12.\n", "\nLike one of the previous reviewers, I just could not get past the heavy alcohol taste that just obliterated anything subtle. This was actually an impulse buy that was on sale, now I think I know why. Cannot recommend this, spend a bit more and get something better.\n", "\nVery smooth and goes down easy with a balanced light fruity flavor. Not a bold flavor that some seek but then again I like light beer and can't stand IPAs. Great for sipping with or without a cube of ice.\n", "\nIt's my go-to for my scotch fix. It's smooth, clean, not hot. I like the highlands as an evening sipper. Glad it's so good, the price is equally nice. I have turned many scotch drinkers on to Speyburn 10.\n", "\nThe straight alcohol taste overpowers all other tastes advertised. I struggled to get through this bottle. I may only be a scotch whiskey drink for a few years and may not have experienced all, but... try something else or spend $10 more and get some Glenlivet 12.\n", "\nMuch better than the price would suggest.\n", "\nAfter drinking this I can't believe the price easily could be an everyday after work drink.\n", "\nI pretty much agree word for word with the anonymous reviewer prior to my review\nI wanted to buy this because in my specialist book this whisky was written up as sweet although its score wasn't so high and I am glad I got to taste this for free recently.\nI would have been very dissapointed if I had bought it\nPretty much a dissapointing whisky!\n", "\nOk the good reviews convinced me to try to save 20 bucks and try this. I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just not very good. I will agree that it has some pleasant notes, but there\u2019s just no body. It just tastes thinned. And it does lack the aroma as well. I think it\u2019s prices appropriately.\n", "\nCan't judge this bottle by the nose up front. But it has a very balanced flavor between sweet and smoky. I agree with JJR, it seams to develop with a little sitting. A touch of warm caramel on the nose and good malty smoky finish. Their seems to be a flavor I can't identify but I like it. Can't beat the price and quality. I can't wait to smell the bottom of my glass when the last of the dram evaporates in the morning.\n", "\nNice flavor. I just bought a bottle this evening. I'll be honest, I didn't like the nose right off the bat (thus 4, as opposed to 5 stars), however I'm a little biased regarding the nose of the less peaty drams, such as this one, so one may want to take that bias into account. I poured a dram and let it breathe for 10 minutes or so. I must say that I am pleasantly surprised. A very pleasant and interesting flavor indeed. I plan to have another dram with a cigar tomorrow evening. I think it will be a perfect complement to a smooth, yet strong stogie, like a La Gloria Cubans Serie N. Looking forward to it. Cant' beat the price on a single malt of this caliber either!\n", "\nIt has a smooth and sweet start and a wee bit of smoke on the finish for a perfect combination - excellent!\n", "\nBalanced, full notes on first sip & swirling & finish.\n", "\nExcellent value\n", "\nAn affordable, smooth, single malt.\n", "\nSmooth, tasty, affordable.\n", "\nNice sipping malt. Goes well with a good cigar.\n", "\nI can't afford Lagavulin and this is an excellent, affordable compromise, with nice depth to the flavor. Very smooth.\n", "\nNose (undiluted)\nYes, Some vague, soft red fruits and...prunes? Citrus waves at you after a few minutes of airing out. Quite a very restrained nose, but very pleasing to my senses, none the less. Hints of vanilla behind all of the fruity, honeyed goodness. Speyside to a \"T\".\nPalate (undiluted)\nThe notes on the box are accurate for a change, this is fairly honeyed. A light bodied offering of vanilla, pretty sweet initially (don't worry, not like a cloying low-quality blend or anything like that), lots of caramel, does some decent drying with a bit of oak, a small puff of smoke, very shy peat, and maybe some white pepper, if that's not my imagination. This isn't the least subtle of malts.\nFinish (undiluted)\nA pretty small puff of smoke and faint, dank wood. It lingers long enough that I do not call it a low-quality affair that ends just about abruptly, but it is on the short side for a malt.\n"]}

Lovely drink, step up from some Irish whiskey I've been trying.\n", "\nI agree that it doesn't seem as good as the old HP 12, which, as Michael Jackson said, was truly the best all-rounder. It seems to have lost most of its peatiness. A delicious licorice aftertaste, with the pineapple edge noted elsewhere. Still interesting, not quite as awesome.\n", "\nI have been sipping this fine malt (always neat in a glencairn glass) for a little over a year & let me tell you the 'old' bottling (which ive been through 3 bottles) tastes exactly the same as the 'Viking honor\"(currently halfway through one of the new bottles). Im from north america and for me its 43% abv. The nose: its very complex with it starting very sweet, lots of sherried fruits of honeyed pears/red apple mixed with that classic highland park orkney peat so sweet & mild, friendly and inviting and also has a spicy character of cinnamon, a very pretty nose. The palate: very sweet sherry arival reminds me of a candy honey, very fruity, the smoke is definitely there but its not nearly as smokey as other island whiskys or islays, the cinnamon spice can be mistaken for alcohol burn or being \"rough\" on the throat, but it is a complex spice that finishes dry, so its typical to drink water alongside your dram. The finish is long, dry, sweet & smokey. My favorite scotch, the first whisky i really shined up to, it is for sure a journey to sip this dram because what you eat makes a big difference, i will also get a big salt flavor and sometimes caramel it will change every day and that makes it very interesting detecting different flavors while you enjoy a glass. Its sweet & smokey with very rich spices, this is the bottle that features all of what scotish whisky has to offer, the very best.\n", "\nOpened my first bottle of the Viking Honor 12 yr after having been a regular consumer of the older bottled 12 yr. What happened? I can barely finish my first glass and thought perhaps my taste buds were off or I had a bad bottle.. Until seeing these other bad reviews...I guess that's just the way it is now. It's so bland and light, with a super sharp alcohol finish. What a waste of money.. Stay away if you liked the previous version\n", "\nOn the contrary, I think all but new whisky drinkers will be disappointed. This represents a continual decline in Highland Park. Also, I think Gavin Smith's review to the left is based on an older UP. Either way, this is cloying and boring, with very little of the delicate peat and Heather notes of old. Docking another point for the dreadful, misjudged packaging and concept. Hope one day they go back to basics.\n", "\nPhenomenal dram! Try it out, you won\u2019t be disappointed!\n", "\nOne of the worst malts I've had over the last years.\nThis was a huge let down. If you liked the old HP12 you will hate this one. I think it's the worst possible option for the money and you're better off buying a Glenmorangie or even a simple Glen Grant 10.\nThe nose is nice, palate is average and lacks complexity and the aftertaste... well... I decided to have a snickers bar afterwards to get rid of it. It's like burnt wood together with old car tyres...\n", "\nMany reviews here say the new 12 year old is not a patch on the old 12year old. My taste buds must be shot because in a blind tasting comparison I couldn't tell the difference between the two. Shop around and you will get it for ?25 which is excellent value for what it is. I do agree they are overselling the Viking \"link\" and the bottle is very pretty but I don't buy a whisky for its packaging.\n", "\nI really don't know what the bad reviews are in aid of here? Perhaps these people know more? Perhaps they are used to drinking expensive single malts? But for a ?30 ish 70cl bottle this really is quite a pleasant scotch. Admittedly I am not a massively experienced whiskey drinker but I have been getting into it more this past year. I currently have this bottle in my cupboard and prior to that I had a bottle of Monkey Shoulder (which was very nice). But I feel that this single malt is a very worthy follow up and I will enjoy every drop of it.\n", "\nA smooth and easy drinking Whiskey. I get a smell of Apple and freshly cut grass, A good start, initial taste of honey. The after taste is a Alcohol fume which is not unpleasant. It is a very easy drinking whiskey but the promised Paetiness never comes through. I bought this for the Paetiness however I am not disappointed with the lack of it because it is a well rounded drink and will buy again understanding that it is not peaty.\n", "\nOver rated from past and appears to have been finally found out. Artificial apple syrup. So many other readily available malts at around this price.\n", "\nGreat!\n", "\nVery disappointed \u2013 the smell is awful, like cheap whiskey, worse than Bell's. Save your money \u2013 don't buy.\n", "\nNo nose or mouthfeel, unless you count alcohol. People that don't like whisky will be able to drink this because it doesn't taste of anything.\n", "\nNot bad for a 12 yr old, but seriously not a patch on 18yr old... It's like comparing Talisker 10 to the 18 \u2013 one very superior to other \u2013 but a good introductory dram, and by 12 yr old standards, rather nice!\n", "\nUsed to be great, but the last bottle I tried was undrinkable, I had to pour it away, total waste of money. It is sulphured casks? really, really rough and bitter, a headache and sore throat in a glass. Where is quality control at the distillery?\n", "\nSo, this review is for a bottle of pre-\"Viking Honour\" Highland Park 12 I found at a local gourmet shop. I assume it had been sitting there for awhile since \"Viking Honour\" seems to be the current bottling in circulation. So lucky me to pick up the older bottling of this legendary scotch for a taste!\nReally love the honey-fruit smell. The peatiness is not obvious at first but a definite smokiness comes after getting into a few sips. The mouthfeel is a little thin but the flavors are sweet and syrupy without being overly saccharine. This bottle of HP 12 is definitely well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable. I suppose eventually I'll have to compare it to the current bottling on the market now... hopefully it's not as disappointing as people say.\n", "\nI didn't know what happened before reading these reviews. I'm someone who likes variety, and yet I would often fall back on HP 12 year. It was by far my favorite. I recommended it to friends. I've tried the latest batch and will likely never buy again and retract recommendations.\nI used to like to take a small sip, let it sit on my tongue, and revel in the many nuanced and delicious flavors.\nNow it smells like some hard liquor one would find at a frat party. The taste bites of alcohol with a slightly unpleasant flavor, and little to no finish.\n", "\nSecond bottle review. I reviewed this back in October, just bought a second bottle of this so that tells you something. This is a great scotch at a great price here in Ontario Canada. I would give it 4.5 stars, 43% ABV, great nose and palate. A must try for sure, one or the best values out there.\n", "\nI like sweet whisky but this is sickly sweet and smells of artificial apple. Not bad at all though as has strong and interesting taste .\n"]}

Welcome contrast to The Quinta Ruban Glenmo which ticks the liquid Chtistmas pud box.The fun thing about this dram( an award winner it says on the box ) is how it brings out The whisky geek in me. I sort of concur with alexlovesaredbeg. I did a mental elimination process and ended up on the North East coast of Islay. I would guess it;s either Caol Ila, or a peated Bunna - Reminds me of one I bought at duty free with a fancy Gaelic name...a milder peat than the south shore Islays, A bit more rounded. Very good value for money. I;d say you ain;t paying for the name...\n", "\nIt's brilliant. I think it's Caol Ila :) The smoky, cured meat smell with some fruity notes. Phenolic, slightly peppery with some dark chocolate. Peaty to the right degree. I love it, especially for the price!\n", "\nThis is not a whisky for the faint hearted. It has a real whallop of peat and heat that goes on and on, with some soft fruit in the background. Would be fascinated to know where it comes from, instinct says it's from the high peat end of the distilleries so Caol Ila or maybe even Ardbeg - so the first reviewer is right, this bruiser is really good value for money. The only reason I've not given five stars is it lacks that bit of class to be the very best but a definite 4.5\n", "\nThis is a cracking whisky, tasted this recently and was well impressed. To me if this whisky had the distillers label it would cost a lot more than a mere thirty two pounds. The flavour is powerful and full bodied not unlike a Caol lla.

Just today discovered Glen of the Wild Geese 10-year in a lovely artistically decorated tin that the purchase of which donates to the Glasgow School of Art. As an artist of sorts, I readily made my purchase and sitting now glass in hand, with my lovely view of mountains that stretch southward into the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, I find the flavour most delightful.

Don't add too much water as it breaks down quickly. Better drunk neat IMO.\n", "\nSo sweet, very fruity. Is sugar added? Surely not.\nSweet like Cointreau.\n", "\nStrangely, while I feel like Bowmore 12 is a fine, 4/5 scotch, on the Whisky Exchange where a lot of ratings seem rather inflated, I wish I could give it a 4.5/5. Bowmore 12 is outstanding for the price, and rather unique as an Islay scotch for being inexpensive yet also having a rather restrained peat character. It's sweet and easy drinking with a medicinal aftertaste. The nose is diverse enough to allow other scents in along with the peat. If you're going to keep a cheap, midly smoky Islay around, Bowmore is a great option to have. It's a lot less peaty than your average Islay, and a welcome addition to any collection.\n", "\nGreat whisky. When I tried it first time it appeared to me not very complex, flat taste. But after 2nd or 3dr try I opened the beauty of Bowmore 12. Nice fruit palate with gentle smoke in the back. Very smooth finish. And awesome arome from the glass after you finished it. Something like dried smoked plum with mineral tones.\n", "\nFor budget minded Islay enthusiasts, pretty hard to beat. A solid performer.\n", "\nI would give this 3.5. It's improved in recent years, subtle peated smoke, lovely fruit forward notes and on the nose. It's an entry level and affordable Islay single malt. Bottled at 46% without colour and chill-filtration and it would be brilliant. Even an increase to a tick over 43% would see a jumo to 4/5 stars.\n", "\nFabulous whisky, one of the best bangs for your buck. Great intro to Islay scotch. Nice amount of smoke with a beautiful sweet fruit right behind, sugary fruit like pineapple and figs with a smooth lingering finish and a tail end of peat remaining. One I will always keep on my shelf. 4.5 for me.\n", "\nIt tasted like medicine. I'll stick to Macallan 12 year, thank you.\n", "\nFirst time sipper of this beauty, after the urgings of an experienced Scotch drinker. Should have listened sooner.\n", "\nThis was my first experience with an Islay whisky. At first, the smokiness was all I could tase, but as I became accustomed to this new flavor I began to appreciate it more and more. If this is your first Islay, be prepared for a shock. I first regretted buying this bottle but as I drank, it seemed to be a decent purchase.\n", "\nDisclaimer: I LOVE peaty/smokey single malts. Having lived in Edinburgh in 2016 my colleagues \"introduced\" to every Single Malt distilled in Scotland. I gravitated to all the Single Malts from Islay. I find Bowmore 12 provides the classic Islay smoke, not too much and not too little. Though I prefer even more. My favorite is Octomore! on a smoke scale of 1-10, it's a 12. :) So, if you like it smokey hit Octomore. Which will be a bit more expensive than Bowmore. Really any Single Malt from Scotland is worthy of praise, it's just what pairs well with you. I think Bowmore 12 is a great value and when I sip it it brings me back to my apartment in Young Street, Endinburgh. Cheers!\n", "\nVery smoky and smooth. Easy on the throat but medicinal finish.\n", "\nI really enjoyed this scotch, for my first endever into Islay scotch it was a nice Smokey flavor but not over powering with a nice smooth finish\n"]}

I would pick the 12, 15 and 18 over this one. 2/5 for me.\n", "\nOne of my favourites, plenty to interest the pallet and can be picked up for a more than reasonable price.\n", "\nGreat entry level Islay. Peaty, but with a good malt background and a lot of fruity notes. Great way to ease your friends into more challenging Islays!\n", "\nI like this whiskey very much. Mild and round taste. One of my favorite whiskeys in the world\n", "\nSome people on here have compared this whisky to the Laphroaig Quarter Cask or called this a \"peat monster.\" It is nothing like the Quarter Cask, which is a great, powerful Islay with a long, brush fire finish. It's also not a peat monster, even when compared to any of the standard Laphroaig, Ardbeg and Lagavulin expressions. It is less challenging than the Bowmore 12-year, which is the lightest, least peaty/smoky Islay I keep in my collection. Compared to other Islays, this is a children's drink. There's nothing wrong with that. Everyone likes different things. Drinking ultra smoky Scotch doesn't make you more of a man (or woman). I'm just saying that it's wrong to call a Kool-Ade Islay anything like the Quarter Cask or any actual peat monster.\n", "\nI'm not a whiskey drinker but I really like this one great flavour\n", "\nWow who is Billy A?? His palette couldn't be more perceptive or more accurate.\nA bit harsh but hence the price point... The best in it's $35 class by far. Complex and not boring, just have to get past the burn. The style mentioned above is dead on in each category. Not a ton of body, light but complex. I might actually rate the smoke at 2.5 but that isn't on their scale - rounding up to 3 seems appropriate.\nThe sweetness didn't rob anything and does compliment the mix. Lemongrass and sage would be two additional tasting notes I'd like to throw to the mix. Smoke flavor lingers a long time but is never over powering. Sweet lime finish but not zesty.\n", "\nNot a good scotch can't taste the smoke. Very medicinal tasting. I will not buy again\n", "\nIt seems to be marketed at people, like me who have not tried islay whisky before. It's a nice dram and good introduction. The bourbon cask gives it an accessible sweetness. You get a smack of coconut which gives way to light peat, TCP and vanilla. I thought it was good value. I wouldn't necessarily buy again not because it was bad but as I am keen to explore islay whisky further.\n", "\nI quite like this, and seem to discover something new about it every time I drink it. Tonight I realized there is a distinct and lovely note of chocolate covered toasted coffee bean.\n", "\nThey must have radically changed the recipe for this recently. This is a full metal jacket, balls to the wall, peat-monster. Very enjoyable and better balance than the 12 year old. TCP bandages in honey. Very nice if you like that sort of thing which I do. A nice drying finish makes this a deliciously moreish dram.\n", "\nSurprisingly good quality. Not quite sure why people are so snooty about this whisky but people generally treat Bowmore whiskies as the ginger step child of the whisky world, and they're quite wrong.\nThis is a deliciously smoky sweet whisky with a very tasty and moresish dryness which reminds me of the fine balance of Highland Park.\nIt's a great whisky. Probably on a par with something like Laphroaig Quarter Cask but with distinctive Bowmore freshness.\n", "\nLovely dram. Gentle tasting though immediately Bowmore. Just let it breath for a few minutes in the glass and enjoy as it comes. No h2o required imho. I received a bottle for Christmas and I would buy again myself.\n", "\nThis is a nice smoky peaty whisky but not over powering. Decent length from the Bourbon barrel and at the price it's a good inexpensive alternative to the \u00a340 12yo and upwards.\n", "\nThis is the first Bowmore whiskey I've had that I really didn't care for. It tastes very raw and unfinished to me. Of course, I've only had 12 year or older bottles in the past and I'm not a fan of bourbon so I probably should have given my selection more thought.\n", "\nI bought this on offer at a reasonable price. It is a perfectly acceptable whiskey, but is just lacking. The peat is so subtle it is pointless and the finish is that of a cheap blend. Easy to drink, but instantly forgettable.\n", "\nStrong peat signal, but balanced. A little light in the mouth somehow. Attractively priced, but not a knockout.\n", "\nMy new Favorites. Got couple as the price was reasonable.\n", "\nI'm new to scotch whiskies and this was the first bottle I picked up. It was a great price for a first bottle. For a newbie the flavor was great, I tasted some smoke and some sweetness (Vanilla mostly) which was excellent for an introduction bottle.\n", "\nNew to Scotch Whiskies, from the Craft Beer World, thru Bourbon.\nThe Nose is a mixture of Vanilla and Peat. The Palate is pleasantly viscous; the Finish is light but very pleasant Smoke. My nose and palate are not very experienced and this is not the first Islay Whisky I have enjoyed. Having said that, to my taste this is a beautiful Whisky for the price, Flavorful, I enjoyed it Very much!\n"]}

A longer pull justifies the years noted on the bottle, with the expectations brought forth by the aroma made whole. The slight bourbon-esque fuses with a fruitiness of the berry family. Thicker sweet fruits, like the fig from the first impression make a reappearance, albeit in a second rank.\nThe whole experience surprises, from a boring looking bottle with a cheap bright color, to a friendly multidimensional travel through the more typical of flavors.

As I drink it, it makes me think of eating freshly caught fish cooked over a wood fire, sitting on a cliff watching the waves crash against the rocks. The only word I can use to describe this whisky is magical. The aroma is sweet yet pleasantly smoky. The initial taste mostly consists of brine and peat smoke, but as you let the flavour develop in your mouth, it evolves into a lovely sweetness, with nice hints of wildflower. As you swallow it again evolves, bringing out pepper notes. This whisky may not be the smoothest out there, but all the flavours still harmonise perfectly, but in a way that each flavour gets its turn to shine, like an excellent orchestra.

I also purchased at the same time the 18 yr but have not opened it to give a review but will in the near future. I give it four stars today in hopes that future bottling's remain as adverse but subtle in taste as I have come to appreciate in the finer bottling's of single malts.\n", "\nFirst impression had nice peatiness on the nose, but a rather uninteresting mix of brown sugar and spices. I was originally unimpressed with this Jura 10 (only 3 stars), but after deciding to give it one last shot, I noticed interesting chocolate and other flavors that I hadn't before. Probably the biggest disappointment about this single malt is that I feel like I paid too much for something only decent. But it was worth giving it a few tries. Jura seems to be a well regarded island disillery. I definitely have Seven Wood in mind to try next.\n", "\nwow\n"]}

Now I'm drinking my third, Glenfiddich 12 and the difference is very obvious.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I would reserve those ratings for the ultra class of Scotch.\n", "\nI really love the flavors of this scotch, not to mention that it is so smooth with no harsh after bite, I can tell you here in Texas where I live this whiskey would cost you around $65.00 or more now per bottle. In New York a bottle will cost you $124.00 per bottle. When I look for a good bottle of whiskey this is one I always purchase, and one that I love to sip not not drink like its water.\n", "\nSmooth\n", "\nThe nose is pleasant, opens up with vanilla, warm raisins and fruitcake and a light floral tone.

It is light and floral with hints of sweet nutty malt. On the palate there is nuts and fruits. There is a great whisky blog called scotchnoob.com where the writer described this as peanut butter and jelly in a glass. I never would have thought about that myself but is a perfect description.

The loam and earthen notes of the nose come through on the palate too. Peat? Yes, of course. It is peated, but not over the top. This is not Laphroaig or Ardbeg. However, there is more intensity than say Bowmore 12. This shares a lot in common with Isle of Jura offerings. I can see where Black Bottle gets its magic.\n\"Finish\" (undiluted)\nGinger and kippers transition into a cloud of black smoke rising up from a bunch of damp branches burning down on the beach on a cold winter's day.

Oak, barley sugar, hops and lager notes.\nFinish (undiluted)\nBig salt licks, stewed apples, dried apricots, burnt toast and a flourish of peat. The salty tang hangs nicely. The finish is quite grippy and mouth coating. You'll be salivating like Pavlov's dogs! This is due to the high ABV.\nRecommendation - Add a little water!\nIn light of the ABV of 48%, it does taste a little hot on the finish. The high ABV contributes to the big mid-palate and mouth tingling finish. I prefer this malt with a little water.\n ", "\nGot it from a whisky tasting in Antwerp(Belgium). Very good value for money.

If my next bottle is like this I will never purchase it again.\n", "\nThe main note I get is \"grassy\". Reminds me of Kilchoman, in this respect (thought not as oily). Many people love this taste, as it seems common to traditionally made whisky, but its not for me. I commend Glen Garoch for presenting this in natural color with non-chill filtering, & respect what the new ownership has done with this distillery\n", "\nThis glengarioch 12 is supberb, probably one of the best value for money. Bottled at 48% this just explodes with flavour. It tastes like highland park 12 but stronger and without any peatness. I am extremely picky with my scotch. After reading up many reviews I''m glad I grabbed this. Will not disappoint, just coats your mouth with a thick honey oaky syrupy type of feeling. Will always have this in my collection now. Excellent daily dram mmmm!\n"]}

Very good.\n", "\nThis is quite possibly the most overwhelming Single Malt ever to fill a glass. While I am by no means an expert, I never thought I would see such regard for this bottle.\nThe flavor is simply that of burned wood, I imagine this is what the tar on your backyard grill would tast if it where whisky. At little sweet on the approach, this has been described (by my friends) as nauseating to drink.\nI have tried to serve this to guests several times. Not one person has finished a glass.\nSo if you live in the Chicago area, the bottle is yours. Please, please take it.\n", "\nUnfortunately I left it to the last minute to buy a bottle of Talisker for Burns night. I was confronted with a choice of either Sky or Storm, having previously drunk the triple distilled version I wasn't familiar with either option. I opted for the Sky version and was presented with a whisky that was very, very poor. It was unlike any Talisker I have drunk before, very disappointed.\n", "\nThe ideal Breakfast Scotch ;)\n", "\nThis Storm is replacing my sadly empty Talisker 10.

I would definitely buy this again.\n", "\nThe olfactory effects of this fine Islay offering elicit fond memories of working with various coal fired steam locomotives. It is my favorite.\n", "\nThe first taste is sweet Caramel and then comes an oily-ness and subtle Peat, and then an antiseptic burn which is a light numbing that mingles disconcertingly with an disinfectant nose that takes getting used to. A fine creamy sweetness of that Caramel at the finish, all the flavours and smells of smoke and Caramel are well defined and separated. Clearly a complex 12 year old and classically Islay. Smoother than Lagavulin and none of the brute force of a Laphroaig. Great value.\n", "\nI'm reading reviews which have 5 star assessments and wondering if I just sampled a counterfeit COAL ILA 12 last night at a friend's table.

On the nose a slight salty brine with wonderful banana and pineapple sweetness and just a subtle hint of peat.

Toffee and ash are the two main properties for me but I\u2019m still learning. Perfect balance.\n", "\nWhen I first tasted this my overwhelming impression was of disinfectant. After persisting I got used to it and started to like it. Having now just found a quarter of a bottle in the back of the cupboard (must be at least a year old) I am really quite enjoying it.\nI shall have to get some more Islay's to compare.\n", "\nWonderful dram. The Caol Ila 12 leads with classic Islay peat, earth, and smoke. However, the whisky is not as peated as an Ardbeg or Laphroaig. But it's definitely still an Islay. In addition to the earthiness and peat of this dram, there is a definite sweetness. I can taste pears as well as vanilla in it. This is a must have for peat lovers.\n", "\nyeah, caol ila12, the malt may be the the island's mr. consistent, but diageo, the owners of the malt have sworn to keep their consistency about reducing the quality of fine malts.\nChill filtered whiskes DO taste thinner and less than the non chill filtered ones. Those who dont believe this, get any chill filtered malt and a non chill filtered one and have both side by side, and you will note the difference.\n", "\nSmoky, fresh and TCP on the nose. It tastes sweet and smoky (I think there is something to be said about the 'smoky bacon suggestion) Lovely drop. At around ?45 it's stunningly good value.\n", "\nIt has good favours and aromas, good complexity going on. But Diageo Diegeo Diageo!!! why the hell do you ruin a perfectly good malt, why you strip off its quality and flavour. The current bottling of Caol Ila 12 is noticeably thin in the mouth, extremely thin mouthfeel, nothing oily or rich about it... Again, it has good complexity, good start, good development, good finish, but really awful mouthfeel.. just for the crappy mouthfeel, I doubt Im ever going to get another bottle of this again. I mean... seriously, would it kill Diageo to stop chill filtering their malts and bumping the alcohol to 46%, as it is these days, the barley being used is commercial, so while it is high in yield it lack in richness, so given this, I think Diageo should give us our money's worth by NOT chill filtering their single malts.\n"]}

It\u2019s heavily sherried which is also unusual for an Islay whisky. On the nose and initially on the palate this presents itself as a sherry bomb. Somewhere in the middle something coastal and medicinal kicks in. The initial sherry sweetness is well balanced by the tangy mineral like coastal notes. I\u2019ve probably had over 30 entry level single malts over the last eight years and for some reason I\u2019ve been reluctant to try this. I wish I had done so sooner.

Thanks.\n", "\nOn first opening I thought I had stumbled into a 1950s operating theatre that had been chemically debugged, twice!!, by over zealous orderlies. There was definitely the thought that too deep a nose-full would knock me into unconsciousness deep enough for a full gastrectomy. However, I took the plunge but only half finished my dram and left the glass on my study desk only to discover it again two days later. In that time a miracle had happened - not water into wine but industrial antiseptic into an exceptionally delicious whisky: mellow and light as a fairy's kiss. To my mind this simply shows that you distillery guys are too impatient and over-fuelled on testosterone. It is no good having to pour a dram a day or two before consumption so please, please, please, you Bruich boys, age it longer in cask and handle it with kid gloves ... then you will get many more people coming back for more.\n", "\nA very nice Islay whisky with some gentle smoke. It would be amazing if they were able to age this for another 8 to 10 years. We have to support the distillers like them that are doing things the right way until they are able to age their stocks for longer!\nN:\nLemon and lime sherbet with smoky bonfire and black pepper.\nVanilla, unbaked sugar cookies, salt spray, paprika, eucalyptus, and almonds\nFloral daiseys and buttercups, apple juice, white chocolate, icing sugar, slight red wine tannins, and barley sugar\nP:\nLemon lime oakiness, white pepper, with slight vanilla\nAlmonds, unbaked salted sugar cookies, slight bitter white chocolate, spicy cloves\nMild bonfire smoke, sackcloth, apple juice, salted butterscotch donut custard.\n", "\nReally good single malt for being a young whisky.

Also similarities with Ledaig 10. Peat reek is fairly strong, unmistakenly Heaviky peated. High ppm comparable to Lagavulin imo. Malty and fruity. Ash from cask or feints quite strong on the nose. Cereal, Leather and mushroom, phenols, popcorn, rubber, inside of a tea pot, all from the feints in the spirit.\nSlight vanilla and caramel, but not a lot of wood spice from lignins or lactone from the cask, suggesting a second or third refill American White Oak.\nPalate salty as expected from an ISLAY, distinctly oily, mouth filling, cinnamon ginger and nutmeg detectable in palate and finish, which is medium to long.\nA good alternative to Ardbeg, but not as fruity, as Ardbeg has very short foreshots only 10 mins.\nGuaiacols rather than medicinal or antiseptic Cresols suggest a lower combustion temperature of the peat.\n", "\nThe sweetness of the barley nicely offset with a good punchy finish. An enjoyable Islay whisky. I would buy again.\n", "\nA young firery spirit from which the peatyness escaped during the voyage to Oregon, USA.\n", "\nHad this at the distillery. It was slightly better than the PC \"Islay Barley\" to my taste. Halfway between Laphroaig & Lagavulin tastewise.\n", "\nA very enjoyable whiskey that was enjoyed by both my wife and I (who often have differing tastes on such matters)!\n"]}

The Talisker Storm is a thousand times better.\n", "\nOne of the better tastes for a very fair price.\nSlight smokey taste and aroma with a very small tinge of port.\n", "\nAn absolute stunner, notes of Port were very noticeable but not overpowering. Only reason I gave it four stars was because it lacked the peat found in Tali 10/18/Skye/Storm etc. with that being said, this is now my 2nd favorite single malt scotch. I would not reccomend this to someone searching for the \u201ctraditional Takisker Smoke\u201d, but on the other hand I definitely think Tali fans should try it, just as I have.\nNose- Dried Fruit, Cherries, Light Honey, and a minuscule note of brine, and even less smoke.\nPalate- Port right off the bat, followed by oaky- earthy flavors. Brine, and a hint of iodine and smoke.\nFinish- smooth, sweet, and savory. I almost didn\u2019t want to swallow it. Cherries, Port, a very small amount of brine. Almost a tiny hint of bitters which complimented the rest of the flavors, although the bitters could have just been in my head. Mild-warming feeling going down, extremely satisfying dram that can be enjoyed by all Tali fans. There\u2019s no doubt it stands alone in the Tali line up, but there\u2019s a reason for that. Tali produced a dram without the pepper and peat for their consumers who weren\u2019t a fan of things like that, but as someone who drinks Octomore without even a dash of water, Tali Port Ruighe is not only a universal dram, but an excelllent dram for all scotch connoisseurs. Final note- it does not have an age statement(NAS), byt leaks from the distillery say it\u2019s 7-8 years old, which is fine by me. I\u2019d reccomend this to everyone who enjoys Tali to experiment with this, and everyone who are not high peat scotch drinkers to pour a dram and share it with the friends and family. Worth the money 5x over.\n", "\nOrdered this because my father loves Tali 10 and I enjoy scotch aged in Sherry/ports casks. While this was fantastic, it didn\u2019t have anywhere close to the level of peat in Tali 10. If you\u2019re looking for a sweet, lightly peated single malt- I\u2019d recommend this\n", "\nIts nice. But not amazing. I mean if you have some spare cash lying about, its certainly worth giving it a go, but there are better out there for just a tenner more, bowmore 15, talisker distillers edition and glenglassaugh peated portwood are all better and more lip smackingly good. This is just good.\n", "\nNice whisky\n", "\nA very tasty whisky, full bodied with a lot of depth and character. Sweetness and the port come through, with a subtle smoke that builds nicely.\n", "\nOur family has roots from the Isle of Skye and we visited the Talisker distillery last year. We bought our first bottle of Talisker Port Ruighe after enjoying some at Sandy Bell's in Edinburgh. We enjoy all the Talisker whiskies, but Port Ruighe has become our family favorite. It's impossible to find in the States, but the Whisky Exchange makes it possible. The Port Ruighe is wonderful from start to finish, and it appeals to many different palates.\n", "\nWow! So many rich flavours, smokey, sweet, loads of depth and great value for money.\n", "\nA perfect mixture of smokiness, flavour, richness and a whiff of the Minch\n", "\nI really like Talisker, I've been to the distillery a couple of times and I think the balanced smokiness of their whisky really works, so I thought I would give the Port Ruighe a go. To me the port cask has diminished the smoke so if you like a gentle sweetish smokey whisky but with a bit of \"grunt\" then you will like the Port Ruighe, I've given it a 4 star as I prefer the smokiness of the more traditional Taliskers but I can still appreciate that this is a nicely balanced whisky at a decent price.\n", "\nA friend brought it back. Great warmth with a variety of sensory treats. Can't find it here in Hawaii\n", "\nLove this addition to their range! For my taste it is spot on. Slight sweetness compliments the smokiness and will keep this on my go to list for sure\n", "\nThis is a very nice smoky whisky with the delicious sweet notes of port but it needs more refinement. Good but not great.\n", "\nI'd concur with the majority view on this one: it's a perfect balance of the Talisker maritime taste with the fruitiness of the port finish. Just a touch too potable, it didn't last as long as I should have made it last . . . .\n", "\nFantastic sweet start and then smoky finish\n", "\nLoves smoked mackerel finish. Shocked, with awe the first time round, would most definitely recommend every time.\n", "\nWhat a beautiful whisky from Talisker. rich and fruity with great lingering taste on the pallate and with that hint of smoke, this is a real winner for me.\n", "\nPeat Whiskeys are always my preference and Talisker one of my favourite distilleries but Port finished Whiskey after numerous tries with different distilleries does not live up to the hype.\n", "\nI wasn't sure that a wine finished malt would be at the top of my list. Recently, I tried this with a rack of lamb dinner and was just exceptional. As an after dinner malt with lamb or fish, this Talisker stands out. I highly recommend this and I just purchased my second bottle of it. I like the balance of the smoke and the sweetness.\n"]}

Let me pour a dram. Ha, ha, ha! If the Highland Park rates a ten, this Beinn Dubh rates a minus 3. It's awful. Made for swanning around socialites, I'd say. Still, I'll have to lie to my poor brother who gave it me just to keep the old family relations on an even keel.\nSpent a week living on the old Ardbeg Distillery manager's house back in '93 when it was temporarily shut down, got the tour of Islay distilleries with him to introduce me. He had a few personal bottles from a Bruichladdich special keg bottling that was the best malt I ever had. Ridiculous. That distillery was also closed at the time, a bit of a low point for the malt whisky industry. Then it got popular for the hipsters and all these distilleries re-opened, and there's enough special bottlings to drown a sinking ship, which rather strays from the original point. It was ever thus when an industry becomes over-commercialized and over-hyped, forgetting the point. So this Beinn Dubh seems like an opportunistic run at making money to me, as an ancient purist.\nBeen through just a few malt whiskies since 1970. This Beinn Dubh is a convenience malt made to profit from the burgeoning trade of people thinking they're going to be whisky connoisseur experts among their friends, I'd say. Sorry. Young, not stated age Glenfiddich is superior and pretty near machine-made judging from my visit. 100 proof Glenfarclas from the friendly distillery not far away is ten times the liquor.\nDear oh dear.\n", "\nJust sipping a wee dram of this in the Carindow Stagecoach Inn, Argyll. The manager has told me how to pronounce the name twice but I still can't...anyway. Black treacle in colour with great thick legs, typical speyside cakes on the nose. A moderately powerful burn on the palate. Rolling the liquid around the mouth intensifies that burn revealing no further flavour than christmas cake with a hint of plum. A little milk chocolate on a lingering finish.\nOverall its ok but not great especially considering the price of the bottle which is in a price bracket that coule buy 2x superior budget bottles or any number of better bottles in the same price.\n", "\nFantastic worth ever penny\n", "\nPleasantly surprised been enjoying my national drink for a number of years now aged 70 will notify friends who wish to know what I want for Xmas future birthdays to get me Beinn Dubh leave the amount up o them\n", "\nUnique experience you must know your whisky to fully appreciate it\n", "\nTotally underwhelming. The bottle speaks of dark mystery, the price promised a quality dram but my overall experience was disappointing.\nThe nose was a cross between toffee and Christmas cake, the taste was slightly bitter brown sugar and molasses.\nThis didn't last long on the palate, even with a dash of spring water.\nAll in all, a bit of a let down. I won't be revisiting this one I'm afraid.....\n", "\nThis is a rich and flavorful whisky. It is fruity and spicy like a good Christmas cake. A bit pricey, but for special occasions, a nice treat! Purchased my first full size bottle after picking up a sample bottle on my last trip to Scotland. Definitely will order again!\n", "\nI originally bought this just for the colour. Indeed, a colleague initially thought it was dark rum!\nMy first impression wasn't great with a slight vinegar-y smell although that may have just been me as I didn't get that all the time.\nFlavour wise I get raisins and sultana with a slight spiciness. Nice warming finish.\nI'm in too minds as to whether I'll buy this again. I like the taste but at the price I'm reluctant. If it was \u00a310 cheaper it would be a definite yes.\n"]}

The usual Macallan rancio sherry fruit is kind of in the background behind the spice from the oak.

As far as I\u2019m concerned that\u2019s the real Macallan. I think it\u2019s worlds better than the Macallan fine oak series which they wisely made to appeal to current trends. I\u2019m a relatively young whisky drinker (41). However, when it comes to scotch I\u2019m pretty old school. Sherry or peat (or some combination of the two).

The nose is really not that enjoyable, but once it touches your tongue the whisky coats it with a warming syrupy sweet elixir and seems to evaporate and warm the entire inside of your mouth. The 60% worried me a bit and I was expecting to have to add water; so I only pored half the sampler.

Thank you Glenfarclas, great job, this single malt is to whiskies what AK47 is to weapons - rough, tough and unrefined, but yet uncompromising.\nP.S. I like it neat - to my opinion even a few drops of water or single ice cube muddle it.\n", "\nWhat a great dram for those long winter nights, sweet nose, sherry influence is quite dramatic, when freshly poured there is a strong apple note developing into freshly made toffee. needs time to open up fully. A few drops of water help to bring the sherry more foreward. there is almost a slight sulpur tinge to it for a short spell while it opens up bit more.left for a longer time 15 -20 mins or more it really shows a creamy caramel nose.The body, as many have noted a spicy, full on mouthful definitely not for the faint-hearted. strong berry notes after a min or so. personally i find the finish similar to a good South Australian shiraz. it''s got a good strong spicy berry note. Fantastic whisky for the price.\n", "\nNose: The beginning is like your nose was run over by a Sherry Train.. wow so much of it!! Along with it comes notes of dark chocolate.. bold spices...pears...possibly some wood and vanilla in there too..\nPalate: The palate's like a continuation of the sherry dominance.. although not as dry as you'd expect it to be.. there's the characteristic sweetness .. with a lot of black pepper and cinnamon spices.. there was also some nutty notes in the mix\nFinish: This was a Sherry story so every aspect of this expression had profound influence from the cask.. the finish too was drying .. fairly long.. and spicy too.. some where in there were also hints of mild smoke in the background\nTo be honest.. its a decent dram but.. definitely didn't get me going wow about it. However given all the awards that this has won.. I'm very tempted to have to give it another shot.. and this time with some watering down to probably get some of that magic that I missed this time around..\n"]}

It leaves you feeling warm and content.\nI\u2019m glad it\u2019s not aged anymore than it is, as the crispness of it is one of its abiding features.\nIt\u2019s by far the best lowland ever made in my opinion and it\u2019s certainly rivals Islays best.\n", "\nOne of the best whiskies my other half has tried, the sweetness finished with the smokey taste leaves a pleasant taste on the palate for being young, highly recommended\n", "\nI'm surprised at the positive reviews for this whisky. I wasn't particularly impressed by it at all when I tried it recently. It's smoky and a little sweet. And not a lot else. Most obviously it tasted young, too young.\nFair enough if you're selling it at ?30 a bottle. But at ?50 it's in the same price range as some serious scotches. Including quite a few very good smoky ones if that's your thing that offer more complexity than this for your money.\nWhat's to like? Its NCF, natural colour, bottled at a decent strength. All to be commended. If they gave it a few more years in the cask and gave it an age statement say 8-10 years old, it might be a very interesting whisky.\n", "\nHaving read the previous reviews I understand the Kilchoman comments but for me this malt was in a different class. Outstanding compared to other similar whiskeys. If the aged malts live up to this then they will be deservedly high end products.\n", "\nA lovely little Lowlander, although peated. And maybe a wee bit to young.\n", "\nloved this, was perfect for me\n", "\nWOW! I come from bourbon. Slowly making my way in to the malts. I\u2019ve just got this, drinking this as I type. THIS is exceptional! This has shot right up in to my favourite whiskies, for the age I can\u2019t see anything close to this. Smooth even at 48.8%,Ashy smoke not aggressive. It\u2019s the main note over the top of honey/syrup. Undeniably meaty and a lovely finish. This will always be in my collection now.\n", "\nGreat Whisky (for his age). Fast delivery. Everything is perfect. ??\n", "\nNot for me. I think this has been released too early - could do with a few more years to let it improve. A splash of water made it a bit more easy to drink - think this one will last a long while in my collections as i have little desire to taste it again.\n", "\nExcellent complex with a long finish\nSmoke and peat with almond and honey\nA joy to savour\nMore smooth flavours come through with a dash of water\n", "\nA most unusual dram. It certainaly did not disappoint. Peaty, smokey and rich which left a lovely aftertaste on the palate.\n", "\nI got given this bottle from a supplier and it is a truly amazing whisky. I love smokey whisky like Ardbeg, this doesn't hit you with the smoke so much but has the right amount combined with its sweetness. Well worth getting a bottle or two!\n", "\nI'm new to whisky but having tried a wide range of single malts I have discovered that I'm a huge Islay fan. As stated this is nothing like any other lowland whisky, and I would liken it to an Islay. My absolute favourite so far, bottle is nearly gone after 3 weeks. Smoky, peaty medicine balanced perfectly with a superb sweetness! Love it!\n", "\nOrdered this a few weeks ago. Remarkably similar to Kilchoman range, heavy earth and bonfire combined with some sweet notes. Taste gives away not yet matured spirit, but longer maturation in good-quality casks could transform it into a nice peated dram.\n", "\nAs a fan of anything from Islay I was attracted by the description \"peaty and phenolic\". Could anything from the mainland possibly stand comparison I wondered . Well yes now it can . Already good enough as it is, after ten years in the cask I'll happily part with three figures for the more mellow expression when that day comes.\n", "\nYou can tell it is a young whiskey as the 'sweet peat' batter your taste buds like an over excited pup, without much substance in between. However, it grows, and it's easy-ish to drink. I'd bet that if you left this in the cask for 20 years you'd have a really good dram.\n", "\nI fell in love with this whisky. It felt like drinking smoked candy. Rich in flavor but still smooth as silk. It seemed so balanced - I really couldn't find anything in it that I wouldn't like.\n", "\nSweet, peaty & meaty. Yummie. I very much like this one.\n", "\nI'm no expert but I must say that this tastes very similar to the Kilchoman Loch Gorm. Nice and sweet with bitter peat.\n", "\nSeems nice and intresting\n"]}

My view is this is not worth the money and your money would be better spent on a different Fiddich finished dram and that I''m so disappointed and also if I wanted some sherry I would buy some sherry but I wanted a whisky finished sherry and not a whisky that shows of the sherry if you get that !\n", "\nNice, smooth sherried \"wedding cake\" theme like Akis pointed out.

Just excellent\n", "\nI just Love Lagavulin. I find the 16yo Distiller Edition to be one of the best whisky on earth, really. But what the hell is this 8 y/o? I hope I had a bad batch, because my bottle is close to undrinkable. It taste like 100 ppm peat mixed with some engine oil. Absolutly disgusting!\nIt is a shame because I love peaty whisky, I have about 20 different Islay single Malt on my shelf and none of them are so bad.\n", "\nPersonal taste really matters with this one, but you should never depreciate it just because you're not used to scotch from this region. It's sweeter and more mild than the standard 16yo (compare Laphroiag's main market offering to Laphroiag Select Cask, but not quite as sweet and blunt).\nExtremely approachable even for newcomers to Islay Scotch, there's a gentleness and fresh herbal taste reminiscent of Japanese styles. Finishes long with a smoky but still very clean mint influence, a lot of herbal and fruity flavors for an Islay. This might be the best dram I've ever tasted, let alone secured its place among the best whisky I've ever tried.\nDangerously good and infuriating rare, I can't think of anything I've ever had that is measurably better. Give this a try.\n", "\nPerfect balance!\n", "\nI never liked Lagavulin as much as it\u2019s two neighbors on the south shore of Islay, with Ardbeg 10 being my favorite. For that reason, I never gave this stuff a second thought when it was first released at almost $100 a bottle. Now that this is an official Lagavulin bottling , and no longer a limited edition, it goes for $48 where I live. I figured I\u2019d give it a shot. I\u2019m happy I did. If you love Islay whisky, or good whisky in general you should too. While it is unmistakably Lagavulin, it has elements of both Ardbeg 10 and Laphroaig 10. I like it much better than the 16.\n", "\nStunning! Almost as great as the 16YO but with less brininess. Too bad it was a limited-edition release. Thank you Trader Joe's for carrying it in Seattle. I purchased their last two bottles!\n", "\nI like Lagavulin 16 but I'm not paying $100 here in Seattle for it. And frankly, there are other Islays I like more. Found this 8 year old at Trader Joes for about $55 including our taxes.\nI don't know. I like the look of this pale whiskey neat, but it's a bit hot at 48%. A bit of water gives it a cloudy unappealing look, but rounds out the flavors a bit. I think for the price I'd rather have Laphroaig, (my personal fav) and for a bit more I'll buy some Bowmore 12 if I'm in the mood for pepper above the brine of Laphroaig. Not sure I'll buy another bottle.\n", "\nAs much as the glut of \"special edition\" scotches on the market seems to be hitting saturation, there are really good ones you can pick out of the fray of NAS bottles. This special edition at least has a relatively \"youthful\" age statement, and since Lagavulin is practically peerless, this scotch is not going to disappoint the typical Islay enthusiast. Peaty like the 16 year with less leather character, with more salty brininess up front. Delicious scotch and a worthy inclusion to a collection.\n", "\nLagavulin is an absolute favourite of mine in terms of the distillery. The 16 deserves to sit on every shelf, worktop and/or desk of whisky lovers around the world. The distillers edition is incredible given the quality of the 16yr old. The 8yr old in my opinion is a disaster.....I find it almost undrinkable and a kin to an insufferable cousin to one of your best mates. You know they are related but apart from DNA you can find no other feature that makes them comparable. So disappointing and reserved for the wife's uncle who loves any old whisky (given the amounts he can drink)!! I may have a bad bottle but I doubt it...\n", "\nThe depth of my tasting can hardly be compared to that of the producers tasting notes. I simply can not go that quite deep. I am a big fan of the 16 y.o and i must agree that the drip of water simply folds out the complexity of the fruity character hidden in the background. When the smoke and pepper have settled, you almost can touch the fruity essence. A couple of extra bottles can by all means be stored for the future if you have some spare room in your cellar.\n", "\nI prefer it to the 16yr Lagavulin! It's rich and peated to the right amount, but still preserves some freshness that the 16yr does not. I will certainly buy more of this one.\n", "\nVERY GOOD Islay whisky. Has a very similar taste to Ardbeg 10. Already one of my favorites.\n", "\nPunchier than the 16 year old, youthful and lovely level of smokiness. I am stocking up!\n", "\nFinally, Lagavulin character returns! After a recent band aid tasting 16yo which doesn't even remotely compare to the classic 16yo of yesteryear, I bought this in desperation to salvage the 16yo. By mixing the two in roughly equal proportion, the combination of 8yo and 16yo starts tasting complex, much like the old 16yo from the 1990s.\n", "\nNew favourite\n", "\nDon't let the relative youth of this fool you into thinking it is not good. This release is just amazing, it managed to oust the 16yo from being my all time favourite. Slightly sharper on the smoke than the 16yo. Slightly sweeter too, with a hint of citrus. A pleasantly long finish too. Good thing I bought a couple of extra bottles of this limited edition release.\n", "\nFirst try on any Lagavulin , wasn\u2019t crazy for it, too much wood smoke very barbecue like flavor but with that said maybe the 16 yo is better .\n", "\nWonderful. I could drink this every day. All that peat, smoke, and fruit. A beautiful blend of flavors.\n", "\nAt first I was uncertain, such a young Lagavulin did not inspire confidence. BUT its lightly sweet, well balanced and still has all the good stuff of a proper Lagavulin. I love it it.\n", "\nGreat stuff. Much better than expected. Tastes more mature than just 8yo. I would love to see this as a permanent part of the core range. Smoke and spice and vanilla in perfect harmony.\n"]}

The quality casking generates a superior integration of spirit. Nose is unashamedly nutty and rife with vanillin and lemon peel oils. Palate is rich and oily. Unctuous. Supercharged nuts are laced with a petticoat of oily lemon rind. Not shy on ginger. Quite spicy. Has been called \"resinous\" by master tasters. Dry. Hint of peat in background. Best with 1/4 teaspoon of water after letting nectar evolve in glass for 15-20 minutes. A show-stopper which takes a certain amount of experience to understand. A beauty. Maybe not for beginners who may be better introduced to Campbeltown with say, the Kilkerran 12.\n", "\nSuperb! If you\u2019re not obsessed with Islay smoke, you might love this.

As you descend deeper, encounter a mouthful of black tarry espresso coffee that coats the palate with rich melted dark fruits (blackcurrants, blueberries and cherries) and bitter almonds.

However over time decided this isn't my favourite - the sweetness is quite sugary and thin and the balance isn't great... gentle brown sugary sweetness quickly kicks into fiery spice without hanging together well and the aftertaste is quite bitter and drying which isn't really my thing.\n"]}

Adding a touch of water only slightly moderates the massive peat reek which very slowly fades and just allows a little of the sweeter sherried flavours to come through although there is always that burst of peat smoke that dries the mouth.\nFinish: Concentrated peat and thick sherried oak with a deep dryness.\n", "reviewer names": ["\nMary Standley", "\nChris", "\nLord E", "\nJay", "\nAnonymous", "\nKevin", "\nMarie H", "\nBenjamin", "\nAnonymous", "\nRicky Jones", "\nRonaGyuri", "\nLeight", "\nDave Lynch", "\nKevin H", "\nM.

Have given the spirit plenty of time to air in the bottle now half full and in the glass for a couple of hours.

Iodine is strong and overpowers the cask surprisingly, also the smoke is not strong, actually disappointingly weak compared to other expressions from this distillery. The Ortho and Meta Cresols are strong, which is characteristic of Laphroaig due to the low kiln temperature in the initial smoking period, but IMO the smokiness has been sacrificed in this expression.\nNot my favourite Laphroaig and not a patch IMO on the cheaper by far superior NAS Quarter Cask. Again I would ask, is this a sherry butt with insufficient maturation time allocation or simply a seasoned cask?\n", "\n We bought this scotch in St. Thomas initially and loved it so much we wanted more.

Crunchy textured walnuts follow, oozing into golden honeycomb that trickles over sun-ripened sticky dates. Then sparkling floral tones emerge, taking the edge off any cloying sweetness, with the green, almost herbal bouquet of geranium, tempered with musky jasmine and the bright, sharp clarity of narcissus.\nWith water, 18 Years Old reveals a rich oaken, balsamic character that yields to soft vanilla. At this moment, the signature Glenmorangie fruity complex reveals itself in golden apricots and dates mingled with hazelnuts. \nTaste:\u00a0Glenmorangie 18 Years Old slips like silk over the tongue with a full, rounded flavour, starting with grapefruit & orange. The palate is then entranced with an accord of melting honey, creamy malt and aromatic florals that segue into the warm, syrupy nuttiness of hazelnuts and walnuts from the Oloroso sherry casks in which the whisky is matured. Savour the rich, sticky date and fig flavours as they are heightened by the unexpected caress of woodsmoke. \nFinish:\u00a0Lingering and enticing with the subtle sweetness of dried fruit and the nutty dryness of sherry. \n", "reviewer names": ["\nAnonymous", "\nK.

My usual preference is a peated/smoked Islay whisky (Laphroaig, Lagavulin, Caol Ila). I often find that Islay fans find it difficult to get as passionate about other styles of whisky (myself included). If this is the case for you, I\u2019d highly recommend you try GlenDronach 18. This is a wonderful sherry flavoured whisky. On the nose, I got Christmas cake, raisin and cherry bakewell. The taste is wonderful and complex with flavours of almonds, raisins and sherry. The aftertaste gave me a warming richness.\nI also sampled this whisky with a Romeo y Julieta wide body Churchill Cuban cigar - a match made in heaven.\n", "\nThis is such a laid back sherry monster that I always chill with this one.

Dried fruits and toffee\n", "\nA Regal Scotch. While its certainly on the pricey side it tastes exactly like a 100 dollar bottle of scotch should. It has an extremely rich punch of dried fruits, both in nose and palate. I've always been more partial to Islay and Island scotches myself, but this one demands your attention in a similar manner, though with overwhelming richness instead of smoke.\n", "\nstunning whisky and immense color for its age\n", "\nI have been drinking Gelndronach for three years now. At first I bought the 15y/o, the 18y/o,the 21y/o and the cask strength. 15 was good. 21 was too sweet and the cask strength needed diluting and was just never right. The 18 I got at the time was the best scotch ever. When the 15 disappeared it was a clue that maybe the 18 would not be as good. I have bought several bottles of the 18 since and while it is not as great as the 18 two years ago it is still my favorite. This scotch is only for the neat drinker. It is like a fine cognac.\n", "\n5 stars!!!\n", "\nThis is among the best scotches I've ever tried. I had purchased 2 bottles of the 15y.o. on the recommendation of personnel in the Scotch Whisky Experience in Edinburgh and was disappointed upon returning home to the USA in that the 15 was no longer available. I was excited to find the 18 and delighted to find it a superior scotch. Smooth, multiple layers of complementary flavors so subtle...not inexpensive but well matched with much higher priced whiskys!\n", "\nOh the flavours in this is just what I want. I don't have to taste hard for them to come. They're just there. Will definetly have this again, and again...\nIf you do like tasty, sherried Whiskies, this is it.\n"]}

Raspberry and cherry, with Turkish delight and smoky driftwood embers burst from the glass jostling for attention. There is a distinctly summer feel to this dram, no brooding peat monster it has a light, bright and fruity air. As the whisky opens you find the Islay sea breeze, ozone and salty. The oak, both American and French give real depth to the dram, classic vanilla, toasted bread, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, liquorice walnut and almond. Each time you go back to the glass there seems to be a bubble of red berry and ripe plum bursting under your nose.\nPalate: Certainly warming at 59.2%, lively and sweet with icing sugar and marshmallow, bound in smoke. There is a rush to capture all that is taking place. Sweet red fruit and peat smoke melt away slightly as the power of the oak comes through with tobacco leaf and toasted oak. Maple syrup, pecan and coffee are complimented by hints of orange and cooked peach. There is a complexity here that didn\u2019t seem possible on the first sip. As you go back to the glass that initial rush of flavour has become a more complete experience. Nowthere is salt spray, dry smoke and the oak is more prominent, raspberry and plum combine with vanilla and butterscotch.\nFinish: On the finish the peat smoke is a little more medicinal than normal, think bandages and creosote. A dryness from the oak tells of the toasting of the French and the char of the American and the final combination in premium French oak together. The influence of the extra maturation in sumptuous first growth casks has added a layer of fruit that weaves its way through the smoke and into the heart of the whisky. The spirit is viscous and textured allowing a long finish where creamy vanilla, spicy clove and ripe peach melt away from the powerful peat smoke allowing it to finish alone, leaving the Port Charlotte DNA firmly in place.\nCharacter: Lively, sunny, rosy, a wonderful experience and superb combination of fruit laden French oak, strong peat smoke and Islay maturation.\n", "reviewer names": ["\nSteve", "\nAnonymous"], "review times": ["2019-01-31", "2018-11-23"], "rating": ["5", "5"], "reviews": ["\nThis is the best whisky I have ever tried.\n", "\nGreat whisky, easily worth the asking price\n "]}

While Macallan is a top quality mainstream scotch this offering fits into a more underground feel. The smooth balance of the Mac 18 and 25 give way to in your face, bold barrel flavor from the fine oak. The opening is standard Macallan but the mid range mouth feel is best paired with free form jazz, death metal or hardcore trance music. This scotch is spicy and raw while maintaining complete control. The finish starts to pull you in then fades quickly leading to another taste of what has become one of my favorites. Not recommended for beginners but I have a large collection of scotch and still throw down a sip of this one regularly and think it is good for collections.

As a relative newbie, therefore, one of the simplest dimensions of distinction is whether one is an Islay person or not. The Dalmore is definitely a whisky for those in the \"not Islay\" camp. I'd venture as far as to say it's the canonical non-Islay scotch. Not peaty or noticeably smoky at all, but still possessing the rich caramel, vanilla, toffee notes along with a mildly spicy touch.\nIt is one of those rare expressions that starts smooth, stays smooth and finishes smooth. Now, smooth doesn't mean devoid of complexity. The 18 expression is sweeter and smoother than it's 15-year-old sibling, and it makes for a top notch pour over nothing. If you do feel compelled, though, add a cube of ice, not water. You want the perfectly balanced texture to be diluted gradually, not instantly.\nI read about some color being added or this not being non-chill filtered - doesn't matter much, to my palate at least.\nIf there's further need to justify my rating, how about this - I first tried Dalmore 18 at a quaint restaurant in the Highlands during my trip to Scotland and fell in love with it; when I returned States-side I realized it costs at least twice if not more as it costs in the UK. Therefore, even with shipping included, I get a better deal at Whiskey Exchange than anywhere local (assuming it's even available). I rate this scotch five stars because it's so good I am willing to pay international shipping for it.\nGo ahead, get this, pour yourself a wee dram (and then not a wee dram... And then 5 more). It'll be tomorrow morning when you're finally done, and you wouldn't be able to wait for the evening cigar or truffles all over again, just to pour one more.\n", "\nGreat Taste. Smooth to enjoy have it on the rocks.\nThey do add a lil color so wanted to mention.\n", "\nA perfectly balanced and smooth whiskey. Delicious flavour with just the right hint of smokeynes.\n", "\nGreat whiskey and great Company defiantly recommend\n", "\nOne of the finest examples of Scotch whiskey I have had the pleasure of tasting. Nose is very inviting, palate has that chocolatey, smokeyness, finish is citrusy and elegant.\n", "\nI brought this as a gift and it went down really well with the recipient who knows his whisky.\n", "\nMy friends favorite single malt.

Great smooth taste and brilliant nose.\n", "\nRich and smooth. Nice balance of slightly sweet with undertones of oak. One of my top favorites!\n", "\nOpened this evening to celebrate a special occasion with friends. What a treat! Sherry, fruit, spice and wood, all in perfect harmony with one another. The nose on this whisky is one of the best I've ever experienced and the taste is not too far behind. The entire experience is one of layered complexity - highly recommended.\n", "\nabsolute perfection for a non peaty whisky. Very smooth, complex, powerful... flavors are bold, complex, and it hits you hard while maintaining smoothness.\nA masterpiece\n", "\nthis whiskey is just wonderful great flavors ,my first order from this company, all is great packing was great just a great experience will order agian soon\n", "\nWow. If you're a fan of the Dalmore, this is the ticket...though again, as with the 15, a word of caution. Assuming you've tried and loved their entry-level 12 year old single malt, don't expect the same satiny-smoothness here. Yes, the 18 is smooth compared to other scotches, but it has a much more obvious burn to it than the 12 or 15 (probably due to the 43% alcohol). The flavour here is intense beyond reason - all the grapey, heavily-sherried richness of the 12 and the 15 are here in spades, but with an added hint of anise/liquorice-ness and a rough oakiness, along with a distinct cinnamon note. This scotch literally perfumes itself out of the glass, much like a harsh Islay scotch's fumes creep out. If you love the 12 and the 15, and simply want all those flavours maxed out to the inth degree, then the 18 is the ticket. A luxurious, full-bodied highland scotch well-worth trying.\n", "\nLoved it. Strong dark Chocolate and Coffee notes.Great Finish.\n", "\nFantastic - absolutely loved it\n", "\nA fantastic dram, in this price range so so reasonable. Nose is rich, smooth & deep; you can just breath this in forever. Upon taking a sip, the arrival is sweet, complex and packed with character. Had me smacking my lips. Don''t ponder upon getting a bottle, just do it - and you''ll be welcomed into the warm world of great whisky appreciation.\n", "\nThis was my introduction bottle to a Highland region whisky and I must say it was a pleasant encounter. This 18yr is not only is smooth and flavorful in which you shouldn''t underestimate its ability to smoother your palate. It makes you really appreciate the time spent on making such a fine whisky, especially aging it in 3 ways before bottled.\n"]}

As my taste has matured and I have grown older I can appreciate a deep, smokey and peaty whiskey in ways that were foreign to me previously. This whiskey from my favourite distillery is frankly stunning. It deep, infinitely drinkable and wonderfully approachable. The taste is heavenly and smooth with a lovely level warmth. I can\u2019t reckomend it enough and it stands near the top for what Lagavulin has produced. Delicious.\n", "\nordered it because everyone gave it 5 stars...it can't be THAT good surely ?.....it is... ..ordered a Lagavulin 16...because that is my favourite......sorry WAS my favourite....and was tempted by this one...so i treated myself.....and will have to keep treating myself too\n", "\nSmokey and sweet, the perfect combination. Absolutely love this bottle. For anyone serious about drinking whisky, you just simply have to try this...!\n", "\nBeautiful single malt from Lagavulin! Not sure if it's worth the mark up compared to the standard 16 though... An extra few quid for a half in the pub - certainly!! Beautiful looking bottle as well.\n", "\nSmoked, then boom! Sweet. A perfect marriage.\n", "\nThis is my new favourite!\nI enjoy my whisky a lot, and I enjoy many different types, from smooth and fruity to harsh and smoky. So here's the point - I've tried many whiskies and this here has pushed through them to the top of the list.\nFor anyone who's tried Islay malts - Laphroaig, Ardbeg, Lagavulin, Caol Ila, even the latest Kilchoman - and enjoyed them, this here is something you need to try. The standard Lagavulin 16 is something special, a very tasty, smoky dram. So here we are with a malt that was picked by the master distiller who makes the 16 for fun...\nWhy should this whisky need people's opinions before one would invest? Really, if the master distiller, a professional in the game, specially produced this whisky for the enthusiasts to enjoy, we should just trust and try this!\nIn a word, it's amazing. There isn't as much smoke involved as standard Islay malts - however there is plenty of smoke. There's also salt and wood involved. Lagavulin is amazing and this whisky only strengthens that reputation.\nI bought this for a whisky night with another fellow enthusiast and two close friends who enjoy whisky too. They all enjoyed it and gave it a solid 8/10. I myself won't go lower than 9 and that's because I can see deeper into these whiskies and appreciate what's involved.\nThis is fantastic and is a must-try for those who want to try something that isn't a supermarket malt!\n", "\nExcellent\n", "\nBought a bottle of this when visiting Islay last year and opened it a few weeks ago. It's all gone now so I have ordered a bottle of the 1997 edition to see how it compares.\nA fantastic whisky with the smokiness and sweetness in perfect balance.\n", "\nStunning\n", "\nIt is good\n", "\nFantastic single malt.\n"]}

Half way down the bottle, so a reasonable amount of oxidation of the compounds. Has improved considerably over the initial bottle opening dram. Give this expression time.

I could be wrong about casks but I don't think this is Oloroso or PX unless the finish period has been a couple of hours lol. Very nice Ardbeg and adds to the variety in their expressions. Imaginative finish IMO.\n", "\nI drank this against 9 other Ardbegs several other top Islays in a very unusual context in Odessa, where for reasons I can't go in to there was a genuine concern that I was about to be in very serious trouble and possible physical danger. Stood out as the best of an excellent bunch and is certainly now my final supper whisky - if I ever find myself on death row this will definitely be my last round...\n", "\nThin coatline with small beads and legs run slowly reflecting low oil content and higher ABV.\nColour slightly darker than 10 year old, suggesting a very short finish in a sherry cask, unless of course that was a Fino sherry and accompanying dryness which is present, but I suspect Oloroso.\nNose - slighter smoke than usual, chocolate hit, ashy and some gunpowder,, slight dried fruits mainly raisin, slight hint of banana and pear reflecting isoamyl acetate. A licorice background. Slight inside of a teapot aroma. The feinty aromas are typical of the Kildaltons and not surprising given that 60% of the phenols are in the feints.\nPalate - salty, peat smoke is quite strong, chilli and pepper from 1st fill American Casks. A bit of a wolf in sheets clothing given the reduced Ardbeg smokiness in the nose.\nFinish - slightly smoke, slightly sweet, tannic, medium length\nConclusion - is it worth the money? Not in comparison to other Ardbegs, but I have just opened the bottle and to be fair it will probably sharpen up considerably. I prefer the 10 year old over any of the other Ardbegs and Corryvreckan, Uigeadail and Dark Cove over this NAS. Still a nice enough peated whisky and more gentle than most others of the Kildalton strains.\n", "\ni drank a boytle of this whosky.....i have to say it was yje best ardbeg i jave tried and i tried them all\n", "\nLovely whisky looking forward to getting another bottle\n", "\nI'm a fan of Ardbeg but not this release. None of the mouth-coating joy I expect from a bottle of scotch at this price. Honestly to me it tastes like the 10-yr with a bit of young single grain added to it. I might barely give 3 stars but will only give it two because of the failed expectations promised by a limited release. It just doesn't deliver a memorable dram.\n", "\nso good its unreal\n", "\nHmm... young, dry, salty and ashy. I thing Ardbeg special bottlings have reached the tipping point: this is not worth of high price tag anymore. A good malt, but not good enough. I really liked the Auriverdes, but this one reminds me lot of Bunnahabhain Ceobanach, except Ceobanach is little better.\n", "\nA good one! Nice balance and development.\n", "\nOne of the best new releases\n", "\nRipe fruit, sweat, medicinal hint, along with plenty of the Ardbeg smoke and long peat finish . Good stuff.\n"]}

Overall I am very happy with it and enjoying the complexity.\n", "\nGreat Peat Smell, subtle smoke, wonderful maritime salinity provided by liquorice, oak chips.

Then add an ice cube and taste how sweeter it gets. Simply Wonderful.\n", "\nI have been enjoying my single malt scotch for some time now. It became time to restock my scotch and where I buy it were giving free samples of 18 yr. Wow it hit my taste buds like a long lost friend. The taste of hot tar, with licorice with a slight taste of smoke. I stood there not knowing what to say, but I added it to my other scotches I was buying. I now have a dram of it now and then to give me a fine break from my other scotch I enjoy. Yet I see it goes a little faster than I want. So that means I have to go out and buy some more. But this time I am buying more than one bottle of it. Cheers everyone\n"]}

It's a true experience and was far better than the 9.1 or 9.2 which while good, don't have this freshness. May buy another one...\nNose: You get a very strong and fresh barley smell on the first sniff. First day after harvest, with a roaring bonfire somewhere in the distance. A few medicinal and floral notes.\nMouth: Absolutely incredible malted barley flavour, which retains its freshness from the nose. Slight taste of a farm, in a pleasant way. Peat is smoky and salty but not sharp, and surprisingly not overpowering. Incredibly smooth considering its age. There is a mild fruitiness, maybe mild citrus, but more of a grain undertone.\nFinish: Bonfire and barbecue on the beach - leaves your mouth with a taste of toasted grapes - may have had some maturation in wine casks.\n"]}

It is smooth, almost unctuously smooth \u2013 a dram to mull over quietly on a long winter evening in front of a log fire.\nThe original, even more alcoholic Astar was very popular with serious whisky enthusiasts, and I suspect that this will be too.

Soft & mellow, the American oak has nourished the spirit well, its strength has made the 22 year journey a very pleasant experience, as you will discover\nColour: Luminous golden yellow.\nNose: I cannot recall many single malts which have such a disarming and elegant bouquet. Sweet yellow fruits, drizzled with honey and crushed almonds, intertwine wonderfully with freshly picked summer flowers; together they rise serenely on the first pass. It\u2019s a beautiful experience. Then, with a little aeration, it's custard cream and toasted barley, banana bread and vanilla fudge. Marzipan continues to rise, now mingling with a citric twist created by the big sleep beside the Atlantic ocean. The final notes are of the malt and oak, evolving together over 22 years, with the aromatics hinting at the natural beauty of this special place called Islay.\nPalate: At first you feel the power of the spirit. Its taste spectrum is intriguing, with flavours coming together like the threads of a fine tweed. The harmonious aromatics have merged superbly to give a mouth-feel that is the absolute single malt taste experience. The vanilla oak and lemon and honey lead on the first sips, with the soft, yogurt-like fruit flavours a heartbeat behind. Then it\u2019s that brilliant Abernethy Biscuit, a vanilla wafer, and then sparkling like a firecracker all around the taste buds comes that marine citrus meringue flavour. The palate is experiencing an all-time high, and boy is the heart uplifted. The soul is rejoicing and the spirits are soaring. This is truly a rarespirit of exceptional quality. To call it a classic does notcome close; one of the best Laddies I\u2019ve ever evaluated.\nFinish: There is no terminal, no finish. This will remain with you long after the bottle has gone.\nMood: Generous, larger than life.\n", "reviewer names": [], "review times": [], "rating": [], "reviews": []}

Roll the glass through your fingers to rouse the aromas and rich, black charred oak with blackberry jam, dark chocolate, raisin, plum, elderberry and apple appear. Notes of marzipan and lemon meringue pie give sweetness and tell of the Bruichladdich DNA working with the casks. Cedar wood and brown sugar come through as the whisky opens.\u00a0 \nTaste: The richness and vitality of the oak and the fruit is astounding. The soft orchard fruit of the spirit comes through after opening a little, sitting beautifully alongside fragrant vanilla custard. Sip again and taste the dark fruits; date, fig, raisin and chocolate, crystallised ginger and floral red rose. Impossible to define as a particular style this dram twists and changes constantly, each layer revealed adds to the mystery of how this whisky was created. Layers of honeycomb, soft fruit, praline, tobacco coconut and a sublime texture tell of its class.\nMood/Character: There may never be an understanding of how this whisky was created but tasting it and understanding why is more important. To compare and compartmentalise this exceptionally rare and unique dram is to miss the point of a whisky that is the essence of the distiller\u2019s instinct passion and experience. If you must ask, you will never know.\nFinish: Chocolate, apricot, pineapple, classic exotic fruits from well-aged Bruichladdich tell of the quality and balance of oak and spirit.

The fruits balance the marine notes; the oaky nutty ginger flavours combat the peat and the citrus helps cool the heat of the fire. Perfect balance.\nFinish: The heat from the peat embers will warm the soul into the wee small hours and as you awaken next morning your senses will ask: \u201cDid that really happen?\u201d, hoping with all your heart that it will happen again.\nMood: Close your eyes as you inhale, you will be spiritually transported to the island of great distillers, with a terroir unique and natural where the never-ending call of the sea is the anthem of the Ileach.\u00a0\n", "reviewer names": ["\nSteveRacer"], "review times": ["2015-12-04"], "rating": ["5"], "reviews": ["\nUnbelievable for such a young potent, even by Isla standards.\n169ppm phenol obliterates the palette at first sip, staining you now to love no other.

As the initial sweetness fades, some bitter woody notes appear, but are balanced by fruity flavours, with the pineapple kubes from the nose joined by sweet gummi fruit, candied lemon and lychee. Creaminess develops, with lemon posset and a sprinkle of nutmeg.\nFinish: Lychee and honeydew melon initally burst over the palate, replaced by spiced custard and singed Garibaldi biscuits. The sweetness fades to leave freshly sawn oak and a hint of barrel char.\nComment: A very well-made whisky that balances the distillery's orchard fruit character with classic American oak spice and creaminess, and with some of the more tropical fruit notes found in older expressions.

Unexpected notes of strawberry jam, the general profile being seemingly rounder and fruitier than both the previous and the 2008 versions of the Talisker 25. Other than that we do have the traditional notes of pepper, seashells and apples, with a great beefiness (bouillon as well) and quite some almonds just like in the 1970. With water: yes it works very well! We\u2019re getting closer to the 1970 now. More flowery notes, not so usual in Talisker (yellow flowers, nectar). Camphor and eucalyptus. Fantastic. \nMouth (neat): I had thought that despite its very high profile, this one would be in trouble after the legendary 1970 but it\u2019s not the case at all. Sure this is a little less \u2018beautifully mingled\u2019 and a little rougher but otherwise it\u2019s a very rich, fruity, spicy and wonderfully oaky Talisker. It\u2019s just a tad too powerful when neat, so let\u2019s see what happens with water. With water: works well, the profile doesn\u2019t change much (maybe a little more salt and more crystallised lemon) but it got more, say \u2018drinkable\u2019s. \nFinish: long, balanced, rich and very, very \u2018Talisker\u2019. \nComments: a big, big dram but not lacking complexity, maybe thanks to the refill casks.

It\u2019s much more \u2018coastal\u2019, with much more notes of iodine, sea air, oysters, kelp\u2026 As for the fruity side, we left the oranges for more lemons and green apples. Also highly unusual notes of green olives that we never got in any Talisker as far as we can remember. The peat is less \u2018ashy and sooty\u2019, and probably grassier and more organic. With water: it got even straighter, on a pure mix of seawater and lemon juice. Make that a plate of oysters. Mouth (neat): again, what\u2019s striking is that there\u2019s much more lemon and even lime in this \u2018new\u2019 one. Very citric and then certainly peatier than the oldies. Also very peppery, but it\u2019s different pepper when compared with the exceptional 1952. Sharper and also more mineral. With water: it does not get any rounder but, interestingly, closer to the oldies, with these heavy notes of shoe polish that we found in the 1953. Also notes of fresh almonds and always a lot of lemon. Finish: long, heavily \u2018coastal\u2019 now, with the \u2018lemony peat\u2019 striking at the end. Faint tannins (grape skin). Comments: these recent 20 or 25yo Taliskers are all very good and except for wood type variations (there has been some sherry versions), they are all very consistent. What\u2019s more, even if the 1952 is really out of this world, they are in the same league as the oldies and should benefit from a little bottle aging. Only one concern, though: will the corks keep as well as good twist caps (or better yet, tin/spring caps) do?

Or maybe I'm just not that patient knowing how this will taste after 20 or 30 minutes of waiting....\nThe taste is where this malt really shines. Tropical fruits like pineapple and mango or maybe stone fruit like peach... Some real power inside the cheeks, with salt and pepper and then something else like smoke and dirt? Smoked fish maybe? With time you get cinnamon/spice and smoke. The fruit never goes away. The finish is long and it's where I find the normal Talisker signature of some \"chili\" as they say, along with the rest of the flavors that attack during the arrival and development.

Creamy notes develop, with vanilla toffee providing sweetness, and cinnamon and clove giving a spicy contrast. The sweetshop notes from the nose also build, laying down a fragrant, sweet and floral backdrop.\nFinish: Menthol and flowers appear initially, before fading slowly to freshly polished tables and sweet orange juice.\nComment: An over-the-top Clynelish, that focuses on the waxy and floral side of the distillery's character \u2013 the rumour is that older spirit has amplified those flavours, with some younger whisky added to temper the vatting into a well-rounded dram.

This example is full gold in colour (it comes from a refill hogshead). The first impression on the nose is woody; opening an empty drawer in a desk; but with a perfumed note, which grows: sweet peas, carnations, soap (Roger y Gallet carnation soap, to be precise); surprisingly fresh and fragrant. At this stage the flavour is mouth cooling in effect; deliciously sweet; like chewing sugared flowers, with a fresh acidity, like acid drops. Water does not improve the nose, but makes it more waxy; again the flavour is sweet and acidic (sherbert, acid drops), fresh and clean.

Also hints of blackcurrant buds, blackberry jam and finally a little coffee, smoked ham and toasted bread. Also a little walnut stain and maybe poppy seeds. In short, a classic. \nMouth: excellent attack, with a flavourful oakiness (black pepper sauce alike) and various liqueur-filled chocolates. Chocolate-covered prunes. Goes on with fresh and clean notes of blood oranges, raspberry liqueur and just a few herbal notes that may hint at well-aged chartreuse. Hints of cough syrup. \nFinish: long, more on fruit skins and jams. Very pleasant fruity and resinous bitterness. Faint tannicity and liquorice in the aftertaste. \nComments: I think it\u2019s a good example of an old malt where an obvious oakiness brings more substance and complexity. Very well composed and worth its fair price, no doubt about that.

Even stranger, it smells a bit like Swarfega; this and syrup of figs, liquorice and cut grass from an oily lawnmower. Your guests might be pressed to identify it as whisky.

Yet, with water:\u00a0 ho-ho, we got very close to the Lochnagar now. This one has just a little more humus and aniseed. Swims like a champ. Touches of maraschino coming through after a few minutes. \nMouth (neat): Cointreau and coffee, with some cured ham in the background. Sounds weird? It isn't, quite the opposite\u2026 The oak does a large part of the job but it does it well, imparting notes of cedar wood, cigar, bacon (a lot!) and really a lot of bitter chocolate. Yet it's not drying or bitter, not at all\u2026 And it's surprisingly drinkable at such high strength. \nWith water: gets sweeter and rounder although the oak never gives up. Great notes of gentian and other rooty/bitter\u00a0 stuff. Finish: long, with more mint and cough lozenges from the oak. The chocolate is back in the aftertaste, together with lemon zests and more mint. After Eights? \nComments: I think it's very difficult to keep an old whisky balanced when the oak's quite loud but this baby is a success in this respect.

Nose: this is more delicate than the 1983, which suggests an earlier vintage(s). The smoke is sort of shier but also more elegant, the whole being more complex for sure. At random we get notes of fresh bitter almonds (quite a lot), white wine (Sauvignon), wet leaves and mushrooms (a walk through the trees, really), cloves and ginger, smoked tea (lapsang souchong)\u2026 Gets then a little fruitier (ripe apples and pears), grassier and even a tad mustardy. \nWith water: gets a bit farmier (wet hay) and maritime as well (drying kelp on the beach), with also hints of fresh mint. \nMouth (neat): starts unexpectedly fruity (granny smith) but it\u2019s soon to get rather smokier, with big notes of fresh walnuts and crystallised lemon zests together with hints of liquorice, horseradish and green pepper. Gets then grassier and \u201cpleasantly acrid\u201d, if you see what I mean. \nWith water: it\u2019s here that it gets closer to the 30yo\u2019s, with the kind of \u2018majestic austerity\u2019 that we like so much in most Broras. It is to be wondered if they didn\u2019t sort of \u2018dope\u2019 this one with one or two casks of older spirit. Just a wild guess! \nFinish: long, grassy, smokier now, with these very idiosyncratic notes of mustard and salt in the aftertaste. \nComments: we had feared that the new 25 would not hold a candle to the 30; we were wrong. But please give it time and, most importantly, don\u2019t forget to add a few drops of water to it to unleash its full \u2018Broraness\u2019.

First we have mainly honeycomb, figs and quinces coated with mint, eucalyptus and pine resin, the whole then bursting into myriads of secondary and tertiary aromas such as wax polish, hessian, tobacco, mushrooms (both fresh and dried), pipe tobacco, prunes\u2026 Then more tar, peat and liquorice, a tad heavier but never \u2018too much\u2019. Gets finally frankly balsamic (more pine resin, also turpentine, camphor, thuja wood\u2026) Mouth: Starts spicy and fairly tannic but with enough dried fruits and other honeyed bits to back it up. Develops on an obvious citrusy zestiness (orange peel, dried tangerines) and quite some tar and peat, just as in the nose. Quite some pepper too, a little curry and finally quite some cinnamon and a little nutmeg. Classic. Finish: Long for its strength, with more liquorice and quite some mint in the aftertaste, as often with these oldies. Comments: I think this one is (well, was) a good example of what \u2018good\u2019 oak can do to a fine distillate. Sure it\u2019s rather oaky, but what a wonderful oakiness.

Soft and as complex as an old Montrachet (if I may say so, sorry about all these wine references but its quicker and easier). With water: s.t.u.n.n.i.n.g. It\u2019s hard to imagine a nicer nose, unless you\u2019re fiercely against peat, zesty tropical fruits and some kind of almond(-iness). Mouth (neat): Ah yes! Many old peaters tend to lose their, well, peat when becoming older but that\u2019s not the case here, not at all. So it\u2019s very peaty and medicinal, with a perfect balance, a perfect mouth feel and a perfect fruitiness, blending passion fruits and lemons. Extremely good \u2013 but that was to be expected. Great feeling of fullness, it\u2019s all perfectly integrated, like in Mona Lisa\u2019s portrait. More oomph on the palate than on the nose (not Mona Lisa\u2019s). With water: please call our friends from the anti-maltoporn brigade! \nFinish: Maybe not the longest but the freshness is impressive. Oysters, pepper and lemon, the perfect combo. Smoked fish in the aftertaste. \nComments: Punters like me will probably talk more about the new Port Ellen, the new Brora and the new Lagavulin, but this Talisker has got this je ne sais quoi that the others don\u2019t quite have, or have to a lesser degree.

In fact, it\u2019s not woody at all at this point. Second, yes it\u2019s rather an \u2018early\u2019 Brora and in truth, it sits right between the 1975 and the 1972 as far as profiles are concerned. That means that it\u2019s pretty smokier than last year\u2019s 32yo (which was quite smoky already) and very phenolic, although it\u2019s obviously lighter and kind of \u2018easier\u2019 than the various 1972s Rare Malts. Are you following me? What Else? Notes of vin jaune again, soot, petrol, flints, then whiffs of fish (think tinned sardines), putty, plasticine, maybe a little fresh butter, wax\u2026 Tends to sauvignonise (hey?) a bit after a few minutes, which can\u2019t be bad news as far as its zestiness and liveliness are concerned. Also a little herbs (fresh coriander, eucalyptus, mint) and wee notes of vegetables (turnips? Parsnips? Celeriac?) I could go on and on, better stop now. Drop water. \nMouth: Well, the oak\u2019s a little more obvious now, especially after the superlative 1972, and the smoke\u2019s also lighter while there are rather more crystallised fruits and other rounder notes, the whole being rather more 1975+ than \u20181972\u2019. Well, that was true for a good 30 seconds but the Broraness never stops growing after that, the whole becoming more and more complex. I get bitter oranges, touches of aniseed, camphor, ashes, hints of tropical fruits (mainly passion fruits and mangos, also lemon), kippers\u2026 all that on a thick layer of ashes and tars that make it so, well, Brora. What\u2019s sure is that it\u2019s not tired at all despite the 35 years and the \u2013relatively \u2013 lower strength. In my experience, that wouldn\u2019t happen at all the other peaters\u2019. \nFinish: Long, sappy, smoky, drier now. Tannic touches. \nComments: Brilliant again, although it may not totally reach the astounding level of the best \u2018pure\u2019 1972s. But more about the 1972s in the coming months\u2026 (shhh!) \n94 points\n", "reviewer names": [], "review times": [], "rating": [], "reviews": []}

A tad less \u2018wild\u2019 than earlier batches in my opinion, but not quite a transition between the 30s and the 25 that was to follow this one. In other words, a true 30. \nWith water: totally Brora. More farmy notes and this superb kind of camphory/antiseptic notes that only old peated glories can display. \nMouth (neat): hugely huge, extremely powerful, sharp and pretty zesty, much less polished than on the nose when neat. Some lemon, mustard, a lot of raw ginger, green apples, cardamom, liquorice, tar\u2026 It\u2019s not exactly brutal but it\u2019s no philosophical malt, if you will. Maybe something of Port Ellen. \nWith water: lemon cake, sweet mustard, quince jelly, smoked tea, civilised kippers ;-) and marzipan. \nFinish: long, with more \u2018peated lemon\u2019 and a little mint. Tar. Notes of lemon sprinkled oysters in the aftertaste. \nComments: a Brora that takes water extremely well. In fact, water is de rigueur here or you may miss the best part. I had thought it would be rounder when I nosed it undiluted but no, it\u2019s a genuine, punchy, early-70s style Brora. There.

I have tried other official Brora releases before (3 other probably), but never such as good as this one ...close to some Port Ellen in a way, though you get the farmy side a few minutes after your first sip. It's even an erotic experience, really...It has it all and includes a visit to a flowery, scents, sweets shop as well at a visit at the shore...ok I stop. I'll conclude saying it is the most serious pretender to the title of \"Best Whisky in the World\" in my opinion, and at least one of the 5 or 10 best whiskies I ever tasted in my life (out of approx. 2700 different whiskies). So please if you buy it drink it and share it with respectful friends, do not speculate on it or hide it for years in the bank/safe....Rating? Impossible or so, but let's try: 100/100 & Beyond any category -Unrational (if there is a rational one?) rating : 500/100....\n", "\nOne of the greatest OB Brora 30 years!

It felt as if more water just kept intensifying the peat until it became almost unbearably powerful. One of the few bottles that deserves to be called legendary.\n"]}

Then we have freshly cut apples, peaches, green melons\u2026 Whiffs of newly cut grass, chives\u2026 It\u2019s probably a little more civilized and tamed than most earlier versions I think, but maybe also a little more complex. No tarry notes, no new tyres this time but it\u2019s very expressive just like that but let\u2019s see what it gives with a little water: not much development but it already told us lots of things. Not exactly a swimmer in fact \u2013 at least on the nose. Mouth (neat): peaty, waxy, salty and lemony, with an almost perfect balance right at first sip. Again, it\u2019s a little rounder than \u2018usual\u2019, maybe a little more \u2018obviously good\u2019 and less austere and sharp than most previous editions. Gets quite spicy (green curry, soft wasabi) and liquoricy before we have quite some fruits such as bitter oranges and tangerines. With water: gets a little fruitier and even spicier, in a beautiful way. Notes of quince jelly, herbs liqueur, parsley and dill, getting more and more peppery, especially at the very long, beautifully sharp and invading finish \u2013 maybe the best part here. Very compact, with a superb earthiness remaining on your palate for ages (plus my beloved old Pu-erh tea).

Behind sits a pool of creamy toffee, spiced up with orange zest and a touch of citrus oil.

A drop of water amplifies the smoke and adds further damp leaves to the fire.\nFinish: More leaves, but spread across damp tarmac.

Water brings out dark sweetness with chocolate and old wood, makes the sweet fruit more noticeable and adds in some briney seaweed.\nFinish: Long, warming and chocolatey, with sweet earthy smoke.\nComment: Big, dark and rich with more smoke than I\u2019ve ever found in a whisky this old.

Now some over-ripe fruit behind (plums and pears), also some moist brown sugar; sandalwood still apparent. After several minutes a vinous note emerges, very faint.\nFlavour: (straight) Smooth, mouth drying. Light sweetness to start, but dry overall. Long finish, with a hint of chocolate.

I should have tried it sooner\u2026 A complex, rich but very elegant sherriness, blending oranges, sultanas, milk chocolate and the most subtle notes of cinnamon and other spices. It really reminds me of some high-end mulled wine, maybe mulled wine made with some Hermitage Chapelle 1978? (the horror!) Seriously, it\u2019s a fabulous nose so far. High-end chocolate. With water: fa-bu-lous development on many herbs and spices. Sultry but not heavy at all and very complex. Amazing. Mouth (neat): extraordinarily good! Stunning resinous and sappy attack, much more nervous than expected, more citrusy than other old Glenfarclasses. And many herbs and many spices\u2026 Only the high power is slightly \u2018too much\u2019 for this sissy of a taster so I\u2019m eager to add a few drops of water to this utter beauty. With water: exceptional! Please call the anti-maltoporn brigade! Hundreds of candied fruits and thousands of herbs. And an amazing \u2018 vibrancy\u2019. Finish: long, big, penetrating. Endless \u2013 warning, it\u2019ll kill your tasting session, which is what just happened here at WF Towers. Comments: only one regret, not to have tried this one when it came out in 2008. What an utter sherried beauty! Vattings of two or three casks are often more complex than single casks, as we already found out several times with Mr. Samaroli\u2019s old bottlings, for instance. Or when mixing the remnants of a wee tasting session. This 40-105 is another perfect example! SGP:662 - 94 points.\n", "reviewer names": [], "review times": [], "rating": [], "reviews": []}

Also cigar box, thuja wood and very ripe blackberries. What\u2019s quite incredible is that the whole is still quite fresh and lively, and certainly not sluggish. I like it. \nMouth: thick, oily, rich, not weak at all despite the 40%, and more of a classic now. Heavy notes of rum-soaked raisins, figs, old rancio (huge!) and orange and herbs liqueur (like that famous Dantziger Goldwasser). Gets then spicier, mainly on cloves and pepper, with very funny hints of mescal as well. Excellent, really. \nFinish: long, coating, rich but clean and pure, with a faint saltiness as the signature and an aftertaste on blackberry jelly.

Spiced cake and dried fruit provide a balancing sweetness.\nPalate: An initial launch into clove studded oranges and mulled wine, with fragrant arabica coffee, dark chocolate and umami. The flavours then lighten and lead towards an\u00a0explosion of fruit - ripe mango and guava are balanced by grapefruit and juicy mandarin. Behind this, gentle honey sweetness and barley sugar combine with ground nutmeg and cinnamon to give a complex and rounded body. Given time, tarragon and cedar wood compliment\u00a0leafy mint and cooked blackberries.\nFinish: Soft orchard fruit and bread pudding linger on the palate, with touches of hazelnut, fresh mint and citrus juice leaving you ready for another sip.\n", "reviewer names": ["\nAnonymous"], "review times": ["2017-06-23"], "rating": ["5"], "reviews": ["\nBeautiful packaging and great whisky!\n"]}

Cardamom, caraway, ground ginger, nutmeg, green curry\u2026 Stunning, really. There\u2019s also these very maritime notes (kelp, iodine, wet beach) and these floral ones (lilies and peonies, beautifully heady here.) An amazing whisky \u2013 no, rather a perfume from the very best makers\u2019. \nMouth: frankly, I had thought it would all happen on the nose, but it\u2019s not the case at all. Superb attack all on passion fruits (my mum would say \u201cbuy passion fruits, it\u2019s cheaper\u201d) and then mastic-flavoured Turkish delights, a little roasted argan oil, lemon pie, all kinds of soft spices, high-end lemon squash and, as expected, notes of oak, with a very pleasant and subtle bitterness as a signature. And there\u2019s well a little peat lingering somewhere\u2026 \nFinish: probably not extremely bold but amazingly clean and straightforward for a short while, getting then very subtle and complex again. Whispers, but whispers for a very, very long time... \u2026 \u2026 \nComments: is this an \u201canti Black Bowmore\u201d? Probably, as it\u2019s very subtle, complex and maybe sometimes a tad \u2018diaphanous\u2019 but always very wonderful. And what a nose! The epitome of elegance as far as whisky is concerned....

Mango, Papaya, guava, and pineapple with vanilla and foreign spices blending seamlessly. They are just going back and forth with the occasional floral notes and then every so often, a wave of Islay (light peat, salt, iodine, and seaweed) comes to show itself. Then it sinks back under the tropical fruit, vanilla, and an amazing blend of spices forming a masterpiece of a perfume that is so complex, you need to nose it in waves before your nose fatigues. Then the perfect blend of spices and fruit form a tea that only a true connoisseur can appreciate, before just a hint of star anise comes to present itself for another level of complexity.\nThe taste is malty with citrus and spices that then develops a light mix of both sweet and bitter peat. It then gets a bitter and quirky fruit coming forward like passion fruit that is infused in that same tea that was on the nose.\nAt first, the finish is just delicate citrus and a is still a little bitter, but then fruit starts again allowing it to become more balanced and smooth out the bitter flavors. Then a sweet dessert with caramel and sugar cookies show up before that same tea comes back to stay for what appears to be forever. 10 minutes later and it still is here.\nI am concentrating so much on the unbelievable complexity that my eyes just started to tear and I have gotten the chills. This is just like listening to Mahler''s Symphony #8 (Symphony for a thousand) where it is so huge in the variety of flavors and complexity that it just leaves you speechless and in awe when it is finally finished. It is truly a masterpiece and now after 15 minutes of just sitting here in awe, the delicate tropical fruit comes back.\nUnbelievable.\nThe Gold Bowmore may have more intense flavors, like Lychee, but nothing and I mean NOTHING can hold up to the complexity of this.\n"]}

This cask had been hand-selected by the founders of Gordon & MacPhail, and was destined to be one of the last filled during the wartime period, as Glenlivet halted production in spring 1943. As the world slowly rebuilt itself the single malt aged peacefully, until it was bottled in June 2013 as a rare piece of whisky and wartime history.  This Glenlivet 70 Year Old from Gordon & MacPhail's Private Collection has complex notes including dark chocolate, orange, treacle, liquorice and subtle, ashy smokiness. Each in the series of just 40 gold-engraved decanters, is presented in a hand-crafted wooden box and comes with a commemorative book and certificate of authenticity.\n", "tasting notes": null, "reviews": null, "rating": null, "review times": null, "reviewer names": null}
